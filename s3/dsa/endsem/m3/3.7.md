# Module 3.7: Applications of Graphs

Graphs are one of the most versatile and widely used data structures in computer science. Their ability to model relationships between objects makes them indispensable for solving a vast array of problems. This section explores some key applications of graphs and their related algorithms.

## 1. Social Networks

Graphs are the fundamental data structure for modeling social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and X (formerly Twitter).

*   **Representation:** Each user is a **vertex**, and a connection (friendship, follow, etc.) is an **edge**.
*   **Directed vs. Undirected:**
    *   On Facebook, friendships are mutual, so the graph is **undirected** (if A is friends with B, B is friends with A).
    *   On X or Instagram, follows are not necessarily mutual, so the graph is **directed**.
*   **Applications:**
    *   **Finding Friends of Friends:** A Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from a user's node can find all people at a certain "distance" (level 2 for friends of friends).
    *   **Recommending Connections:** Algorithms analyze the graph to find nodes with many mutual connections to suggest new friends.
    *   **Influence Analysis:** Identifying "influencers" can be done by finding vertices with a high **degree** (many connections).

> **What to look for:** A complex, web-like structure where nodes (representing people) are connected by lines (representing friendships). Some nodes will be more central or have more connections than others.

## 2. Pathfinding and Navigation (GPS)

Navigation systems like Google Maps use graphs to find the best route between two locations.

*   **Representation:** Locations (cities, intersections) are **vertices**, and the roads or paths between them are **edges**.
*   **Weighted Edges:** The edges are **weighted** to represent distance, travel time, or traffic conditions.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path between a starting node and all other nodes in a weighted graph. This is the core of many GPS systems.
    *   **BFS:** Can be used to find the path with the fewest road segments (shortest in terms of edges, not distance).

> **What to look for:** A map overlayed with a graph where intersections are nodes and roads are edges. The edges should have numbers on them, representing weights (distance or time).

## 3. Computer Networks and the Internet

The internet itself, as well as local computer networks, can be modeled as a graph.

*   **Representation:** Computers, routers, and switches are **vertices**, and the physical (cables) or logical connections are **edges**.
*   **Applications:**
    *   **Packet Routing:** Algorithms find the most efficient path for data packets to travel from a source to a destination.
    *   **Network Broadcasting:** BFS can be used to model how data is broadcast from one node to all other nodes in the network.
    *   **Network Resilience:** Graph analysis can identify critical nodes (vertices) or links (edges) whose failure would disconnect the network.

## 4. Task Scheduling and Dependency Management (Topological Sort)

In many projects, some tasks must be completed before others can begin. This creates a dependency relationship that can be modeled with a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

*   **Representation:** Tasks are **vertices**, and a directed edge from `A` to `B` means task `A` must be completed before task `B`.
*   **Algorithm:** **Topological Sort** is an algorithm that finds a linear ordering of the vertices such that for every directed edge from `u` to `v`, `u` comes before `v` in the ordering. This gives a valid sequence in which to perform the tasks.
*   **Cycle Detection:** If a cycle is detected in the graph (e.g., A depends on B, B depends on C, and C depends on A), it means the tasks cannot be completed in any order. DFS is commonly used for cycle detection.

> **What to look for:** A directed graph (with arrows) where the nodes represent tasks. The output should be a linear sequence of those nodes, showing a valid order of execution.

## 5. Spanning Trees in Network Design

A **spanning tree** is a subgraph of a connected, undirected graph that connects all the vertices together with the minimum possible number of edges (`V-1`) and no cycles.

*   **Application:** Designing efficient and low-cost networks. For example, connecting a set of houses with electrical or internet cables. You want to connect all houses (vertices) using the minimum amount of cable (edges) without creating redundant loops.
*   **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** In a weighted graph, an MST is a spanning tree with the minimum possible total edge weight. Algorithms like **Prim's** and **Kruskal's** are used to find the MST, which is crucial for minimizing costs in network design.

> **What to look for:** An image showing a weighted graph with all its edges, and next to it, the same graph with only a subset of edges highlighted. The highlighted edges should connect all nodes without forming any loops, and their total weight should be minimal.

## Questions

<details>
<summary>1. Explain the difference between directed and undirected graphs and give a real-world application for each.</summary>

*   **Undirected Graph:** Edges are bidirectional. If there is an edge between vertex A and B, it implies a connection in both directions.
    *   **Application:** Facebook's friend network. If you are friends with someone, they are also friends with you. The relationship is mutual.

*   **Directed Graph:** Edges have a direction, going from an origin to a destination. An edge from A to B does not imply an edge from B to A.
    *   **Application:** X (formerly Twitter) or Instagram's follower network. You can follow someone without them following you back. The relationship is one-way.

<summary>2. You are designing a system to lay fiber optic cable between several cities. The cost of laying cable between any two cities is known. Which graph algorithm would you use to find the cheapest way to connect all the cities? What is the name of the resulting graph structure?</summary>

The most appropriate algorithm would be one for finding a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**, such as **Prim's algorithm** or **Kruskal's algorithm**.

*   **Representation:** The cities would be the vertices, the possible cable routes would be the edges, and the cost of laying the cable would be the weight of the edges.
*   **Goal:** The goal is to connect all vertices (cities) with a set of edges (cables) such that the total weight (cost) is minimized and there are no redundant cycles.
*   **Resulting Structure:** The final layout of the cables would form a **Minimum Spanning Tree**.

<summary>3. What is a topological sort, and in what kind of graph is it applicable? Provide an example application.</summary>

A **topological sort** is a linear ordering of vertices in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. For every directed edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v`, vertex `u` comes before vertex `v` in the ordering. If the graph contains a cycle, a topological sort is not possible.

**Example Application:**
*   **Course Prerequisites in a University:** Courses can be represented as vertices, and prerequisites as directed edges. For example, an edge from "Calculus I" to "Calculus II" means you must take Calculus I first. A topological sort of this graph would provide a valid sequence of courses a student can take to fulfill all prerequisites.
