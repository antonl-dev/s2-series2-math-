### Section 1.2: Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

1.  Explain the concept of an Abstract Data Type (ADT) with an example. (From *Internal Test - 1*)
2.  Differentiate between an Abstract Data Type and a Data Structure.
3.  What is information hiding and how does it relate to ADTs?
4.  Can a single ADT be implemented by multiple data structures? Provide an example to support your answer.

### Section 1.3: Basic Complexity Analysis

1.  Explain the concepts of best case, worst case, and average case complexities with the help of examples.
2.  What is asymptotic analysis? Explain its importance in the context of algorithms.
3.  Explain the three asymptotic notations (Big O, Omega, and Theta) used to express the complexity of an algorithm.
4.  What is the best, worst, and average case time complexity for searching an element in a linear array of size `n`?

### Section 1.4: Analyzing Programs and Space Bounds

1.  What is space complexity? What are the different components that make up the space used by a program?
2.  Analyze the time complexity of the following code snippet. Explain your reasoning.
    ```c
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j = j * 2) {
            // Some O(1) operation
        }
    }
    ```
3.  Compare the space complexity of an iterative algorithm versus its equivalent recursive algorithm. Use an example.
4.  Why do we usually ignore constant factors and lower-order terms when analyzing complexity?

### Section 1.5: Complexity Calculation of Simple Algorithms

1.  Write the algorithm for insertion sort and perform a detailed analysis of its best case, worst case, and average case complexities. (From *End Sem Exam*)
2.  Find the complexity of the following code, which calculates `a` raised to the power of `b`. Explain how you arrived at the answer.
    ```c
    int power(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        return a * power(a, b - 1);
    }
    ```
3.  What is the time complexity of a simple algorithm that finds the maximum element in an unsorted array of `n` elements?
