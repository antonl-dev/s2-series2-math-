# Module 1: Basic Concepts of Data Structures

## 1.2 Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and Data Structures

This section covers a fundamental concept in computer science: the distinction between the logical description of a data type (the "what") and its physical implementation (the "how"). Your teacher heavily emphasized this topic as a core concept for the course.

### 1. Abstract Data Type (ADT)

An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a conceptual, high-level model of a data type. It acts as a **blueprint or specification**. The ADT defines two things:
1.  A collection of data.
2.  A set of operations that can be performed on that data.

Crucially, an ADT defines **WHAT** the operations do, but it **does not** specify **HOW** they are implemented or how the data is stored in memory.

This principle is known as **data abstraction** or **information hiding**. The internal workings are hidden from the user, who only interacts with a clean, simple interface.

**What to look for:** A diagram showing a clear boundary. On the outside, an "Application Program" calls simple functions like `push()` or `pop()`. On the inside, the complex "Implementation" is hidden.

#### Key Characteristics of an ADT
*   **Behavioral Specification:** It defines the set of values the ADT can hold and the operations that can be performed on them.
*   **Implementation Independent:** It provides no details about how the data is stored (e.g., in an array or a linked list) or how the operations are carried out.
*   **Interface:** It presents a clear interface to the user, allowing them to use the data type without needing to know its internal logic.

### 2. Data Structure

A **Data Structure** is the **concrete, low-level implementation** of an ADT. It is the specific way data is stored and organized in the computer's memory.

While the ADT is the logical concept, the data structure is the physical reality. It defines **HOW** the data is organized and **HOW** the operations are actually performed.

*   **ADT Focus:** What operations can be done.
*   **Data Structure Focus:** How data is organized and how those operations are implemented.

### 3. ADT vs. Data Structure: A Comparison

This is a very common exam question. The key is to understand that an ADT is a logical specification, and a data structure is its physical implementation.

| Feature        | Abstract Data Type (ADT)                                      | Data Structure                                                |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **What it is** | A logical concept, a specification, a blueprint.              | A concrete, physical implementation in memory.                |
| **Focus**      | **WHAT** operations can be done (the interface).              | **HOW** the data is organized and the operations are done.      |
| **Level**      | High-level, abstract.                                         | Low-level, concrete.                                          |
| **Visibility** | The user interacts only with the public interface (operations). | The internal details of storage and algorithms are defined here. |
| **Purpose**    | Information hiding, modularity, making code easier to manage. | Efficient storage, retrieval, and performance.                |
| **Example**    | `List`, `Stack`, `Queue`, `Map`.                              | `Array`, `Linked List`, `Hash Table`, `Binary Tree`.          |

**Analogy:**
Think of a car.
*   The **ADT** is the driver's interface: a steering wheel, accelerator, and brake pedal. You know *what* they do (turn, go, stop), but you don't need to know *how* they work.
*   The **Data Structure** is the underlying engine, steering column, and braking system. This is the actual implementation that makes the car's operations possible.

### 4. Example: The `Stack` ADT and its Implementations

As highlighted by your teacher, the Stack is a perfect example to illustrate this concept.

#### The Stack ADT
The `Stack` ADT is defined by its LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) behavior and its set of operations:
*   `push(item)`: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
*   `pop()`: Removes the item from the top of the stack.
*   `peek()`: Returns the top item without removing it.
*   `isEmpty()`: Checks if the stack is empty.

Anyone using a `Stack` only needs to know about these operations. They don't need to know how the stack is built.

#### Data Structures that Implement the Stack ADT

The `Stack` ADT can be implemented using different data structures:

**Implementation 1: Using an Array**
*   **How it works:** A fixed-size array is used to store the elements. A variable called `top` keeps track of the index of the last element pushed.
*   `push()` involves incrementing `top` and adding the element at `stack[top]`.
*   `pop()` involves returning the element at `stack[top]` and decrementing `top`.

**Implementation 2: Using a Linked List**
*   **How it works:** A collection of nodes is used, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. A `top` pointer always points to the first node in the list.
*   `push()` involves creating a new node and making it the new `top`.
*   `pop()` involves removing the `top` node and making the next node the new `top`.

In both cases, the ADT's interface (`push`, `pop`, etc.) remains the same for the end-user. The choice of data structure (array vs. linked list) is an implementation detail that affects performance and memory usage, but not the logical behavior of the stack.
