#### Coping with Stress
*   **Definition:** It means recognizing the source of stress in our lives, recognizing how stress affects us, and acting in ways that help us control these levels of stress.
*   **Application:** This can be done by changing our environment or lifestyle and by learning how to relax.

#### Coping with Emotion

**🤖 Practice Question:**
How does the professional skill of "Having the Big Picture" relate to the WHO core life skill of "Decision Making"?
**Answer:**
"Having the Big Picture" is the ability to understand the overall context and long-term goals of a situation. This directly enhances the WHO skill of "Decision Making." When making a decision, a person with a "big picture" perspective can assess different options not just on their immediate outcomes, but on how they align with larger objectives. It helps them to be proactive, anticipate future consequences, and choose the option that provides the most sustainable and beneficial result in the long run, rather than just solving a short-term problem.
