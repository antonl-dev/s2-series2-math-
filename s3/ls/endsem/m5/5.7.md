## **Topic 5.7: Engineers as Expert witnesses and advisors**

This section covers the specialized roles engineers play within the legal and political systems. As expert witnesses, they help courts understand technical issues from past events. As advisors, they help policymakers make informed decisions about the future. Both roles require a high degree of objectivity and ethical integrity.

### **1. Engineers as Expert Witnesses**

*   **Role Definition:** In legal cases involving technical issues (e.g., accidents, product failures, structural collapses), engineers are often hired to provide an expert opinion. Their function is to explain the technical causes and aspects of a past event to the court.
*   **Expert Witness vs. Eye-Witness:**
    *   An **eye-witness** testifies only on what they directly saw or heard (perceived facts).
    *   An **expert witness** provides a professional opinion. Their role is to:
        1.  Give an expert view on the facts in their area of expertise.
        2.  **Interpret the facts** in terms of cause-and-effect.
        3.  Comment on the views of experts from the opposing side.
        4.  Report on the professional standards that were or were not followed.

#### **Ethical Abuses and Biases of Expert Witnesses**

The role of an expert witness is fraught with potential for ethical abuse, as they are paid by one side of a legal dispute.

🧠 **Mnemonic:** "**H**onest **M**oney **E**arns **S**ympathy"
*   **H** - Hired Guns
*   **M** - Money Bias
*   **E** - Ego Bias
*   **S** - Sympathy Bias

1.  **Hired Guns:**
    *   **Description:** This refers to an expert who tailors their testimony to favor the lawyer who hired them, often distorting the truth or withholding information. While lawyers are expected to advocate for their clients, an engineer's duty is to the **truth and to justice**, not to the client directly. A "hired gun" acts as a biased advocate rather than an objective expert.

2.  **Money Bias:**
    *   **Description:** The expert's professional judgment is influenced or prejudiced by the desire to make a fortune or gain a reputation that will lead to more high-paying work.

3.  **Ego Bias:**
    *   **Description:** The expert develops a bias based on the assumption that their own side is innocent and the other side is guilty. An excessive desire to "win" the case and be on the winning side can cloud their objective judgment.

4.  **Sympathy Bias:**
    *   **Description:** Sympathy for a victim in a case can upset the expert's testimony, causing them to interpret facts in a way that favors the victim, regardless of the objective evidence.

#### **Duties of an Expert Witness**
To avoid these biases, an expert witness has several key duties:
*   **Objectivity:** They must be objective in discovering the truth and communicating it honestly.
*   **Truthfulness:** They must answer all questions truthfully, but they are not required to volunteer evidence that is favorable to the opponent unless asked.
*   **Confidentiality:** They must maintain the confidentiality of their investigation's findings, just as they would in a consulting role, unless required to disclose it by the court.

### **2. Engineers as Advisors in Planning and Policy Making**

*   **Role Definition:** Engineers are often required to act as advisors to governments and private organizations on matters of public policy involving technology (e.g., energy policy, infrastructure planning, environmental regulations). Their role is to provide expert guidance on the potential future consequences of different policy choices.

#### **Requirements for Engineers as Advisors**

1.  **Objectivity:** The engineer must study the costs and benefits of all possible alternative options in an objective, unbiased manner.
2.  **Study All Aspects:** They must conduct a comprehensive analysis, studying not just the technical feasibility and economic viability, but also the operational feasibility, social acceptability, and environmental and ethical impacts of a policy.
3.  **Uphold Values:** The advisor must possess honesty, competence, diligence, and loyalty. Crucially, their loyalty must be to the **common good and public trust**, rather than just serving the narrow interests of their clients or political patrons.
4.  **Handle Technical Complexity and Uncertainty:** Policy advising deals with the future, which is full of uncertainties. The engineer must be transparent about the assumptions and limitations of their analysis (e.g., population projections, future costs).

#### **Models of Advisory Roles**

There are different models for how an advisor can behave:
1.  **Hired Gun:** The advisor's primary obligation is to the client. They highlight data that is favorable to the client's goals and treat unfavorable aspects as insignificant. Public welfare is a minimal concern.
2.  **Value-Neutral Analyst:** This assumes an impartial engineer who presents all the facts and analyses objectively, without bias, fear, or favor, and without advocating for any particular outcome.
3.  **Value-Guided Advocate:** This advisor remains honest and autonomous in their judgment but also shows paramount importance to the public good. They will advocate for the option that they believe best serves the public interest, even if it is not what their client wants to hear. This is often seen as the most ethically complete model.

### **Practice Questions**

**1. Differentiate between eye witness and expert witness.**
*(Source: Question Bank, Q 5.19)*

**Answer:**
The key difference lies in the nature of their testimony:
*   **Eye Witness:** An eye witness testifies only about their **direct sensory perceptions**. They can only state what they personally saw or heard. They report facts without offering any interpretation or opinion.
*   **Expert Witness:** An expert witness testifies based on their **specialized knowledge and expertise**. Their role is not just to state facts but to **interpret** those facts for the court. They provide professional opinions on the cause and effect of technical events and comment on whether professional standards were met.

**2. List various abuses of engineers as ‘expert witnesses’.**
*(Source: Question Bank, Q 5.20)*

**Answer:**
The common abuses or biases of engineers acting as expert witnesses are:
1.  **Hired Guns:** Intentionally distorting or withholding information to serve the interests of the lawyer who hired them, rather than serving the truth.
2.  **Money Bias:** Allowing the desire for financial gain or future work to influence their professional judgment and testimony.
3.  **Ego Bias:** An excessive desire to be on the "winning" side, which leads to a biased assumption that their client is innocent and the opposing side is guilty.
4.  **Sympathy Bias:** Letting sympathy for a victim cloud their objectivity, causing them to interpret evidence in a way that favors the sympathetic party.

**3. 🤖 An engineer is serving as an advisor to a city council on a proposal to build a new dam. The engineer's analysis shows the dam is technically feasible but will displace a small village and have a negative environmental impact. The mayor privately tells the engineer to downplay the negative impacts in the public report to ensure the project gets approved. Using the "Models of Advisory Roles," explain the engineer's options and the most ethical choice.**

**Answer:**
The engineer has three options based on the advisory models:
1.  **Act as a Hired Gun:** The engineer could obey the mayor, downplay the negative impacts, and highlight only the dam's benefits. This would serve the client's (the mayor's) immediate political goal but would be a serious breach of professional ethics.
2.  **Act as a Value-Neutral Analyst:** The engineer could present all the data objectively—the technical feasibility, the economic benefits, the exact number of people who will be displaced, and the full extent of the environmental impact—without making a recommendation. This is an ethical option but may not fully serve the public interest.
3.  **Act as a Value-Guided Advocate:** This is the most ethical choice. The engineer would present all the findings honestly and objectively, as a neutral analyst would. However, they would also use their professional judgment to explicitly state that, in their expert opinion, the negative social and environmental impacts are severe and that the council should prioritize these factors. They would advocate for the public welfare, recommending that alternative solutions be considered or that significant mitigation measures for the displaced community and the environment be a non-negotiable condition for the project.
