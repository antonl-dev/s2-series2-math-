## **Topic 5.6: Role in technological development - Engineers as Managers - Consulting Engineers**

This section explores three distinct but overlapping roles that engineers play in society: their fundamental role in driving technological development, their function as managers within organizations, and their practice as independent consulting engineers.

### **1. The Engineer's Role in Technological Development**

Engineers are the primary agents of technological development. Their work involves inventing, designing, building, and maintaining the systems and products that shape modern society. This central role comes with significant ethical responsibilities.

*   **Social Experimentation:** Engineering projects are a form of "social experiment." The outcomes are often uncertain, and they can have unintended side effects on society and the environment. Therefore, engineers have a duty to proceed with caution, monitor the impacts of their work, and learn from past failures.
*   **Sustainable Development:** As technology advances, engineers have a growing responsibility to ensure that development is sustainable. The ASCE Code of Ethics requires engineers to "strive to comply with the principles of sustainable development," meaning they must design products and systems that meet present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own.
*   **Ethical Balance:** Engineers must balance the drive for innovation and profit with their paramount duty to protect public safety, health, and welfare.

### **2. Engineers as Managers**

Many engineers advance in their careers to become managers, where their responsibilities shift from purely technical tasks to guiding people and projects.

*   **Key Managerial Characteristics for Engineers:**
    1.  **Promoting an Ethical Climate:** Managers are responsible for framing organization policies, defining responsibilities, and setting an ethical tone through their personal attitudes and actions.
    2.  **Resolving Conflicts:** A core function of a manager is to resolve conflicts. This requires evolving priorities, developing mutual understanding, and generating alternative solutions.
    3.  **Social Responsibility:** The manager's responsibility is not just to increase the profit of the organization. They share the ethical responsibility to produce safe and good products or services while showing respect for all stakeholders (employees, customers, public).

*   **Managing Conflicts (Recap of key principles from Topic 5.1):**
    *   **People:** Separate the people from the problem.
    *   **Interests:** Focus on the underlying interests, not the stated positions.
    *   **Options:** Generate multiple alternative solutions.
    *   **Evaluation:** Use objective criteria to evaluate the results.

### **3. Consulting Engineers**

Consulting engineers are professionals who work in private practice. They are not salaried employees but are hired by clients (sponsors) for their expert advice and design services on specific projects. This independent status creates a unique set of ethical responsibilities.

*   **Key Ethical Responsibilities of Consulting Engineers:**

    1.  **Advertising:**
        *   Consulting engineers are directly responsible for their advertising. Unlike in a large corporation, they cannot delegate this to a marketing department.
        *   **Prohibited Deceptive Advertising:**
            *   **White Lies:** False statements.
            *   **Half-Truths:** Presenting a prototype as a finished product.
            *   **Exaggerated Claims:** Claiming a major role in a project where their contribution was minor.
            *   **False Suggestions:** Hiding negative information, such as a reduction in strength to achieve a cost saving.
            *   **Vague Wordings or Slogans.**

    2.  **Competitive Bidding:**
        *   This is the process of offering a price (a bid) for services. While organizations have a pool of experts to make bids realistic, individual consultants must build their reputation over time to compete effectively. They must be careful to bid on projects that are within their area of competence.

    3.  **Contingency Fee:**
        *   **Definition:** A fee paid to the consultant only if they are successful in saving money for the client.
        *   **The Ethical Dilemma:** This creates a **conflict of interest**. The consultant may be tempted to specify inferior materials or unsafe design methods to cut costs and ensure they get paid. The NSPE code warns against this, stating that engineers should not accept contingency fees where their judgment may be compromised.

    4.  **Safety and Client's Needs:**
        *   Consulting engineers have greater freedom in decision-making on safety, which also brings greater responsibility.
        *   **The "Design-Only" Problem:** In design-only projects, the consultant may have no role in the construction phase. They must ensure their design is robust enough to handle potential construction shortcuts or material unavailability.
        *   **On-site Inspections:** The consultant has a duty to perform on-site inspections to ensure their design is being implemented correctly and safely, thereby protecting the workers, the public, and the environment.

### **Practice Questions**

**1. List the ethical responsibilities of consulting engineers.**
*(Source: Question Bank, Q 5.17)*

**Answer:**
The ethical responsibilities of consulting engineers are distinct due to their independent status. Key responsibilities include:
1.  **Honest Advertising:** They are personally responsible for ensuring their advertising is truthful and not deceptive. They must avoid making exaggerated claims or false suggestions.
2.  **Fair Competitive Bidding:** They must bid on projects transparently and only within their areas of competence.
3.  **Avoiding Conflicts of Interest:** They must be especially careful with arrangements like contingency fees, where the desire for payment could compromise their professional judgment on safety and quality.
4.  **Ensuring Safety and Client Needs:** They have a heightened responsibility to ensure their designs are safe and to conduct on-site inspections to verify that the construction adheres to the design, thereby protecting the public welfare.

**2. 🤖 A consulting engineer is offered a "contingency fee" where they will be paid 20% of any cost savings they can achieve on a bridge design project. Explain why this creates a conflict of interest.**

**Answer:**
This contingency fee arrangement creates a direct conflict of interest between the engineer's financial self-interest and their primary professional duty.
*   **The Engineer's Duty:** The engineer's paramount obligation is to design a bridge that is safe for the public.
*   **The Competing Interest:** The engineer's payment is directly tied to reducing the project's cost.
*   **The Conflict:** To maximize their fee, the engineer is financially incentivized to make decisions that cut costs. This could include specifying cheaper, lower-quality materials, using a less robust design, or cutting corners on safety features. This financial incentive directly conflicts with their ethical duty to prioritize safety above all else. Their professional judgment is compromised because a decision that increases their pay might simultaneously decrease public safety.

**3. 🤖 How does the role of an "Engineer as Manager" differ from that of a purely technical engineer?**

**Answer:**
The roles differ in their primary focus:
*   **Technical Engineer:** The primary focus is on **tasks and things**—solving technical problems, performing calculations, and designing systems. Their main responsibility is technical correctness.
*   **Engineer as Manager:** The primary focus shifts to **people and processes**. Their responsibilities now include promoting an ethical climate, managing team dynamics, resolving conflicts between people, and aligning the team's work with the organization's strategic goals. While they still need their technical background for credibility and understanding, their success is measured by the performance of their team, not just their own technical output.
