## **Topic 5.5: Global ethical issues - Business, Engineering, Environment**

This section explores ethical issues that transcend national borders, driven by the forces of globalization. It focuses on the interconnected ethical challenges in the domains of international business, global engineering projects, and environmental protection.

### **1. Globalization and its Ethical Dimensions**

*   **Definition:** "Globalization means integration of countries through commerce, transfer of technology, and exchange of information and culture." It creates a complex web of interdependence between nations, corporations, and individuals.
*   **Key Ethical Issues Arising from Globalization:**
    *   **Multinational Corporations (MNCs):** The conduct of corporations operating in multiple countries.
    *   **Technology Transfer:** The ethical transfer and implementation of technology between different cultures.
    *   **Environmental Impact:** Cross-border environmental issues like pollution and climate change.
    *   **International Human Rights:** Ensuring that basic human rights are respected by corporations, regardless of the local laws or customs of the host country.

### **2. Global Business Ethics**

The rise of Multinational Corporations (MNCs) operating in "host countries" (often developing nations) creates specific ethical challenges.

*   **The Problem of Ethical Relativism vs. Absolutism:**
    *   **Ethical Relativism:** This is the "When in Rome, do as the Romans do" approach. It suggests that an MNC should follow the local customs and laws of the host country, even if they are lower than in their home country. **The danger** is that this can be used to justify exploiting cheap labor or adhering to lax safety standards (as seen in the Bhopal case).
    *   **Ethical Absolutism:** This is the approach of applying the home country's standards without any modification in the host country. **The danger** is that this can be impractical and culturally insensitive, leading to conflicts and a failure to adapt to local conditions.
    *   **The Recommended Compromise (Ethical Relationalism/Contextualism):** The most ethical approach is to make moral judgments in relation to local factors but without abandoning core, universal moral principles. This means respecting cultural diversity and legitimate differences while still upholding fundamental human rights and safety standards.

*   **Core Ethical Obligations for MNCs:**
    1.  **Respect Basic Human Rights:** MNCs must respect the human rights of the people in the host countries, regardless of local laws.
    2.  **Provide Benefits:** The activities of the MNC should provide genuine economic and technical benefits to the host country, not just exploit its resources.
    3.  **Respect Local Culture:** MNCs must respect the laws, political setup, and cultures of the host countries.
    4.  **Ensure Safety:** MNCs must provide necessary safety measures for workers in hazardous jobs and obtain "informed consent." They have a duty to maintain equivalent safety standards across all their operations.
    5.  **Fair Remuneration:** They should provide fair wages that are not exploitative.

### **3. Global Engineering Ethics**

Engineering projects are increasingly global, involving teams and materials from all over the world. This creates unique ethical challenges.

*   **Technology Transfer:** This is the process of moving technology to a new setting.
    *   **Appropriate Technology:** The most ethical approach is to implement **"appropriate technology."** This means the technology must be suitable for the host country's social, economic, and environmental context. It should not be a one-size-fits-all transfer.
    *   **Example of Inappropriate Technology:** Transferring large, expensive agricultural tractors to a region of small, poor farms would be inappropriate. Power tillers might be more suitable.
    *   **Example of Appropriate Technology:** Introducing mobile phone technology into remote villages can be highly appropriate as it can connect them to the world without the need for expensive landline infrastructure.

*   **Engineers' Role:** The engineer's role becomes more complex. They must not only ensure technical feasibility but also assess the social and environmental impact of their projects in a global context.

### **4. Global Environmental Ethics**

Environmental problems are inherently global, as pollution and climate effects do not respect national borders.

*   **Definition:** "Environmental ethics is the study of (a) moral issues concerning the environment, and (b) moral perspectives, beliefs, or attitudes concerning those issues."
*   **The Engineer's Duty:** The ASCE code of ethics now explicitly states that "engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public and shall strive to comply with the principles of **sustainable development**." This means meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
*   **Key Global Environmental Issues:**
    1.  **Waste Disposal (Plastic and e-Waste):** The unethical practice of developed countries exporting hazardous electronic waste to developing nations for unsafe disposal is a major global ethical issue, violating the Basel Convention.
    2.  **Depletion of the Ozone Layer:** Caused by CFCs, this is a classic global problem that required international cooperation (the Montreal Protocol) to address.
    3.  **Global Warming:** The emission of greenhouse gases from industrialized nations has a worldwide impact, disproportionately affecting poorer nations that are more vulnerable to climate change. This raises issues of global justice.
    4.  **Acid Rain:** Pollution from one country can cause acid rain in another, highlighting the need for international environmental agreements.

### **Practice Questions**

**1. What are the forms or senses of relative values/relativism?**
*(Source: Question Bank, Q 5.1)*

**Answer:**
The different forms or senses related to relativism are:
1.  **Ethical Relativism:** The belief that an action is morally right if it is approved by the laws and customs of the society in which it occurs. This is the "When in Rome, do as the Romans do" view.
2.  **Descriptive Relativism:** The factual observation that different cultures do, in fact, have different moral beliefs and practices. This is a statement of fact, not a moral judgment.
3.  **Moral Relationalism (or Contextualism):** A compromise view which holds that moral judgments should be made in relation to the specific context and factors of a situation, rather than by applying rigid universal rules. It allows for flexibility without abandoning all moral principles.

**2. 🤖 Explain what "appropriate technology" is and provide one example of appropriate and one example of inappropriate technology transfer to a developing country.**

**Answer:**
**Appropriate Technology:** It is the identification, transfer, and implementation of technology that is suitable for the specific social, economic, and environmental context of the host community. It considers local skills, available resources, and cultural values. It is not necessarily the most advanced technology, but the most suitable.
*   **Example of Appropriate Technology:** Installing solar-powered water pumps in a remote, sunny village with no reliable electricity grid. This technology uses a locally abundant resource (sunlight), is relatively easy to maintain, and meets a critical community need (clean water).
*   **Example of Inappropriate Technology:** Donating a fleet of complex, modern tractors to a community of small-scale farmers who lack the fuel, spare parts, and mechanical knowledge to maintain them. The tractors would quickly fall into disrepair and be useless. Simpler, more robust equipment would have been more appropriate.

**3. 🤖 How did the Union Carbide case in Bhopal demonstrate a failure of global business ethics?**

**Answer:**
The Bhopal case demonstrated a catastrophic failure of global business ethics, primarily through its practice of **ethical relativism**. Union Carbide operated its Bhopal plant with demonstrably lower safety standards than its equivalent plant in the USA. Key failures include:
*   **Double Standards:** The lack of a computerized warning system in Bhopal, which was present in the US plant.
*   **Cost-Cutting over Safety:** Critical safety systems like the refrigeration unit were shut down to save a small amount of money, a risk that would have been unacceptable in their home country.
*   **Neglect of Responsibility:** The company failed in its moral duty to ensure the safety of the host community, applying a lower value to the lives of Indian citizens.
This created a situation where the pursuit of profit in a host country directly led to the violation of the fundamental human right to life and safety for hundreds of thousands of people.
