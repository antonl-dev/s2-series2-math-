## **Topic 4.4: Self Confidence - Social Expectations**

This section explores the crucial personal virtue of self-confidence and the external force of social expectations, both of which significantly shape an individual's behavior and success.

### **1. Self-Confidence**

*   **Definition:** "Self confidence is the quality of believing in oneself and one's abilities." It is the certainty in one's own capabilities, values, and goals. People with self-confidence are usually positive, flexible, and willing to change.
*   **Two Core Components:** Self-confidence encompasses two separate but related traits: **Self-Esteem** and **Self-Efficacy**.
    *   **Self-Esteem:** This is one's innate sense of **self-worth**. It is your value *as a person*. It reflects your evaluation of your own value and the belief that you have a right to be happy, deserving, and loved. It is a fundamental psychological trait.
    *   **Self-Efficacy:** This is the belief in one's own capacity to **perform specific tasks and reach goals**. It is your belief in your *abilities*. Taking on difficult tasks and persevering in spite of challenges are indicators of high self-efficacy.
*   **The Relationship:** You can have high self-esteem (believe you are a worthy person) but low self-efficacy in a specific area (e.g., "I'm a good person, but I'm terrible at public speaking"). True self-confidence is a healthy balance of both.

#### **Characteristics of a Self-Confident Person:**
*   They have a **self-assured standing**.
*   They are **willing to listen** to learn from others and adapt (flexibility).
*   They are **frank** and willing to speak the truth.
*   They **respect others' efforts** and give due credit.

#### **Self-Confidence in the Workplace:**
Having self-confident employees brings significant benefits to an organization:
*   Employees air their views **openly**.
*   They set **higher goals** for themselves and the organization.
*   They have a **better appreciation of others** and their efforts.
*   They have a **lesser tendency to complain**.
*   They are more **open to change**.
*   This leads to **better overall organizational performance**.

#### **The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem (according to Nathaniel Brandon)**
This model provides a framework for the actions that build a strong sense of self-worth:
1.  **Conscious Living:** Being aware of the present moment without losing the wider context.
2.  **Self-Acceptance:** Accepting oneself, including flaws and weaknesses, without harsh judgment.
3.  **Taking Responsibility:** Accepting accountability for one's choices and actions.
4.  **Self-Assertiveness:** Honoring one's wants, needs, and values and expressing them appropriately.
5.  **Purposeful Living:** Having clear short-term and long-term goals and acting to achieve them.
6.  **Personal Integrity:** The harmony between one's values, beliefs, and actions.

#### **Ways to Improve Self-Confidence:**
*   **Accept yourself** and your ability to change for the better.
*   **Do not get bogged down** by others' opinions about you.
*   **Commit to constant learning** as a way of life.
*   **Accept new challenges.**
*   **Practice resilience** (bouncing back from setbacks).
*   **Understand that material possessions do not determine one's worth.**
*   **Practice positive self-talk.**
*   **Practice good posture:** According to Swami Vivekananda, "it is simply impossible to think great thoughts with a bent spine."
*   **Communicate effectively:** Speak up, be sincere, maintain eye-contact, and listen to others.
*   **Be ready to apologize** if you make a mistake.

### **2. Social Expectations**

Social expectations are the unwritten rules, norms, and standards of behavior that a society or group expects from its members. They are a powerful external force that influences an individual's actions, choices, and even their sense of self.

*   **Role in Character Formation:** "The character is exhibited through conduct. Character is determined by the expectations of society." Many people act and live within these social norms, refusing to fall below the minimum standards but also not rising above the maximum expected.
*   **Influence on Behavior:** Social expectations can be a force for good, encouraging ethical and cooperative behavior. For example, the expectation that one should be polite, honest, and respectful helps maintain social order.
*   **Potential for Conflict:** Conflict can arise when an individual's personal values or goals clash with social expectations. For example, a person may feel a social expectation to pursue a high-paying, prestigious career, while their personal passion lies in a less lucrative artistic field. Navigating the balance between meeting social expectations and being true to oneself is a key challenge in life.
*   **In the Workplace:** Social expectations exist within an organization's culture. There are expectations about how to dress, how to communicate, how much to work, and how to interact with superiors. Conforming to these expectations is often necessary for career advancement, but it can sometimes conflict with personal ethics or work-life balance. A self-confident person is better equipped to navigate these expectations, conforming where necessary but also having the courage to challenge expectations that are unproductive or unethical.

### **Practice Questions**

**1. Examine the relevance of self-confidence and factors that shape it.**
*(Source: Second Series test (October, 2024), Q 6)*

**Answer:**
**Relevance of Self-Confidence:**
Self-confidence is highly relevant in both personal and professional life. It is the belief in one's own abilities and worth, which empowers an individual to take action, face challenges, and achieve their goals.
*   **In Personal Life:** It is crucial for building healthy relationships, trying new experiences, and maintaining resilience in the face of setbacks.
*   **In Professional Life:** A self-confident employee is more proactive, communicative, and innovative. They are more likely to take on leadership roles, handle criticism constructively, and contribute positively to the team environment, leading to better overall organizational performance.

**Factors that Shape Self-Confidence:**
Self-confidence is shaped by a combination of internal and external factors throughout one's life:
1.  **Heredity and Family Environment:** The attitudes of parents and the supportiveness of the family environment during childhood play a crucial role in building a foundation of self-esteem.
2.  **Friendship and Peer Group:** The influence of friends and colleagues can either build up or tear down self-confidence. A supportive peer group fosters a sense of belonging and validation.
3.  **Influence of Superiors/Role Models:** Positive role models and supportive mentors or managers can significantly boost a person's belief in their own abilities by providing guidance, encouragement, and opportunities for growth.
4.  **Training and Experience:** Success builds confidence. As a person acquires new skills through training and successfully overcomes challenges through experience, their self-efficacy (belief in their abilities) grows stronger.

**2. 🤖 Explain the difference between Self-Esteem and Self-Efficacy using an example of a student learning to code.**

**Answer:**
*   **Self-Esteem** is about the student's sense of self-worth. A student with high self-esteem might think, "I am a smart and capable person, and I deserve to succeed." This is their general feeling about themselves as a person.
*   **Self-Efficacy** is about their belief in their ability to perform a *specific* task. The same student might initially have low self-efficacy in coding, thinking, "I'm not sure I can learn this programming language; it looks really difficult."

**How they interact:**
As the student starts learning and successfully completes a few small coding exercises, their **self-efficacy in coding begins to rise**. This success reinforces their **self-esteem**, making them feel even more capable. If they struggle, their low self-efficacy might temporarily challenge their self-esteem, but a person with a strong foundation of self-esteem will be more resilient and see the struggle as a temporary challenge rather than a reflection of their overall worth.
