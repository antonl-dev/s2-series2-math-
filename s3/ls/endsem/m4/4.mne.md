### **Analysis of the Lists: Rigid vs. Flexible**

I have analyzed all the lists you've compiled from Module 4. They fall into two categories:

**1. Rigid Lists (High Priority for Memorization)**
These are formal models, frameworks, or codified principles. You should aim to memorize the exact items on these lists, as they are likely to be asked for directly in an exam (e.g., "List the six pillars of self-esteem.").

*   **Basic Elements of a Good Code of Work Ethics** (6 items)
*   **Categories of Civic Virtue** (4 items)
*   **3-Component Model for Organizational Commitment** (3 items)
*   **The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem** (6 items)
*   **The Fundamental Canons of Engineering Ethics** (6 items)

**2. Flexible Lists (Medium Priority - Understand the Concept)**
These lists describe concepts, reasons, or examples. For these, it's more important to **understand the overall concept** and be able to recall a few key examples, rather than memorizing the exact list verbatim. An exam question will likely ask you to "explain" or "discuss" rather than just "list."

*   Types of Values (General vs. Ethical)
*   What Ethics is NOT
*   Examples of Lacking Academic Integrity
*   Key Components of Service Learning
*   Principles of Respect / Peaceful Living
*   Honesty in the Workplace
*   Types of Courage
*   Reasons for Lack of Cooperation
*   Characteristics to Practice Empathy
*   Ethical Failures / Lessons Learned (Case Studies)
*   Essential Roles of a Code of Conduct
