## **Topic 3.2: Group vs. Team, Team Dynamics - Managing team performance**

This section provides a detailed comparison between groups and teams, explores the concept of team dynamics, and outlines strategies for managing team performance effectively.

### **1. The Difference Between a Group and a Team**

While all teams are groups, not all groups are teams. The distinction is crucial for understanding how to build high-performing units. The table from your slide materials provides an excellent, detailed comparison.

| 20  | **Roles**                                                    | Roles and tasks are often fixed                                            | Roles and tasks are rotated as and when required                                                         |
| 21  | **Purpose**                                                  | Members think they are brought together for administrative convenience     | Members are aware that individual goals are best achieved through mutual support and working towards team goals |

**Summary of Key Differences:**
*   **Accountability:** In a group, individuals are accountable. In a team, there is both individual and mutual accountability.
*   **Purpose:** A group's purpose is often the same as the broader organizational mission. A team has a specific, unique purpose that it defines for itself.
*   **Work Product:** A group's output is the sum of individual contributions. A team's output is a collective work product that reflects joint effort.
*   **Process:** A group runs efficient meetings. A team encourages open-ended discussion and active problem-solving.
*   **Synergy:** A group's performance is the summation of its members' individual abilities. A team achieves synergy, creating a potential for performance that is greater than the sum of its parts.

### **2. Team Dynamics**

*   **Definition:** "Team dynamics are the unconscious, psychological forces that influence the direction of behavior and performance of a team." They are the "personality" of the team.
*   **Origin:** Team dynamics are created by the interplay of several factors:
    *   The nature of the work itself.
    *   The personalities of the individuals within the team.
    *   The working relationships among team members.
    *   The relationship between the team and the wider organization/environment.
*   **Good vs. Bad Dynamics:**
    *   **Good Dynamics:** Improve overall team performance and get the best out of individual members. They are characterized by trust, open communication, and constructive conflict.
    *   **Bad Dynamics:** Cause unproductive conflict, demotivation, and prevent the team from achieving its goals. They are often characterized by mistrust, poor communication, and groupthink.

### **3. Managing Team Performance**

Managing team performance is a continuous process of observation, evaluation, and improvement. It is not just about measuring the final output.

*   **Purpose:** It can be used to "help and fine tune that are already performing well" and to diagnose and fix problems in underperforming teams.
*   **Core Principle:** "To work effectively, teams must regularly and objectively review their 'teamwork'." This means looking beyond the *what* (the output) and examining the *how* (the process).
*   **Key Areas to Measure:**
    1.  **Individual Performance:** Are individual members meeting their responsibilities?
    2.  **Individual's Contribution to the Team:** Is the member collaborating effectively, communicating well, and supporting others?
    3.  **Performance of the Entire Team:** Is the team as a whole achieving its goals and working cohesively?

*   **The Process of Managing Performance:**
    1.  **Identify Where the Team Stands:** The first step is "identifying where the team is performing well and where it needs further development." This can be done using tools like a **Team Performance Profile Questionnaire**, which gives an objective assessment of how the team is doing.
    2.  **Diagnose the Problems:** "The diagnosis of the problems is essential." This involves comparing various viewpoints (from inside and outside the team) to get a clear picture of the issues.
    3.  **Fix the Problems:** "Once we know what is wrong, it is usually easy to fix it." The solutions can then be targeted at the specific problems identified, whether they are related to process, communication, roles, or goals.

### **Practice Questions**

**1. List the differences between group and team.**
*(Source: Second Series test (October, 2024), Q 1)*

**Answer:**
The main differences between a group and a team are:
*   **Leadership:** A group typically has one designated leader, whereas a team can have shared or rotating leadership roles.
*   **Accountability:** In a group, individuals are accountable for their own work. In a team, there is both individual accountability and mutual accountability for the team's collective success.
*   **Goal:** A group's members may have a shared interest but work on individual goals. A team is defined by a total commitment to a common, specific goal.
*   **Work Product:** A group produces the sum of individual work products. A team produces a collective work product that reflects synergy and joint effort.
*   **Synergy:** A group's performance is the sum of individual efforts (1+1+1=3). A team aims for positive synergy, where the collective effort is greater than the sum of individual efforts (1+1+1=4).
*   **Interdependence:** Group members are often independent, while team members are highly interdependent.

**2. Explain the importance of managing team performance with an example.**
*(Source: Second Series test (October, 2024), Q 2)*

**Answer:**
**Importance:**
Managing team performance is crucial because a team's success depends not just on the skills of its members, but on how they work together (their team dynamics). Its importance lies in:
1.  **Identifying Issues Early:** Regular performance management helps to diagnose problems like poor communication, unclear roles, or lack of trust before they lead to project failure.
2.  **Fostering Continuous Improvement:** It encourages teams to regularly and objectively review their "teamwork," allowing them to fine-tune their processes and become more efficient and creative.
3.  **Ensuring Alignment:** It ensures that the team's processes and goals remain aligned with the overall vision and purpose, preventing the team from drifting off course.
4.  **Boosting Morale:** When teams see that their performance is being managed constructively and that problems are being addressed, it boosts morale and motivation.

**Example:**
A software development team is consistently missing its sprint deadlines.
*   **Without Performance Management:** The manager might blame individuals, leading to demotivation and finger-pointing. The root cause is never found, and performance continues to suffer.
*   **With Performance Management:** The manager initiates a team performance review. Using a questionnaire and open discussion, they discover the final output is not the issue, but the process is. The diagnosis reveals that the **root cause** is not laziness, but **unclear requirements** from the product owner and a **lack of communication** between front-end and back-end developers.
*   **Action:** By managing the team's performance, they can now take targeted action. They implement a new process for clarifying requirements before a sprint begins and schedule a daily 10-minute sync-up meeting between developers. As a result, the team's dynamics improve, the process becomes more efficient, and they start hitting their deadlines.
