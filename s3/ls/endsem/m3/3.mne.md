1.  **Characteristics of a Group:** (Flexible List)
    *   Frequent interaction
    *   Interdependence and Mutual Influence
    *   Hierarchy, leadership and pattern of rules and norms
    *   Common objectives, common beliefs and common expectations
    *   Cohesiveness and unity among members
    *   **Analysis:** This is a descriptive list. You need to understand the concept that groups have structure and shared purpose, but you likely won't be asked to recite this exact list. **No mnemonic needed.**

2.  **Stages of Group Formation (Tuckman's Model):** (Rigid List)
    *   **Forming**
    *   **Storming**
    *   **Norming**
    *   **Performing**
    *   **Adjourning**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a very famous and structured model. It is highly likely to be asked for by name. **A mnemonic is highly recommended.**

3.  **Structured Steps for Group Problem Solving:** (Flexible/Semi-Rigid)
    *   Define the Problem
    *   Analyse the Problem
    *   Set Criteria for Solution
    *   Generate all Possible Solutions
    *   Evaluate and Select the Best Solution
    *   Implement
    *   **Analysis:** While this is a logical sequence, the exact phrasing isn't as critical as understanding the process. However, a mnemonic could be helpful for remembering the steps in order. Let's create one.

4.  **The Leadership Framework (3 Elements):** (Rigid List)
    *   Leader
    *   Follower
    *   Situation
    *   **Analysis:** This is a fundamental framework. It's simple, but a core concept you must remember. **A mnemonic is easy and useful.**

5.  **Main Features of Transformational Leadership:** (Semi-Rigid)
    *   Inspiring Vision
    *   Intellectual Stimulation
    *   Individual Concern
    *   **Analysis:** These are the core pillars of the theory. Remembering them is important. **A mnemonic would be helpful.**
