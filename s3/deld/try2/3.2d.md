# 3.2.d Decoders and BCD to Seven-Segment Decoders

## 1. Decoders

### 1.1 Introduction

A **decoder** is a combinational logic circuit that converts a binary code from its `n` input lines to a maximum of 2ⁿ unique output lines. For any given binary input combination, only one of the output lines will be active (typically HIGH), while all others remain inactive (LOW).

Decoders are fundamental building blocks in digital systems and are used for:
*   **Memory Address Decoding:** Selecting a specific memory chip or a specific location within a chip.
*   **Instruction Decoding:** Enabling the specific circuitry required to execute a CPU instruction.
*   **Data Demultiplexing:** Routing a single data stream to one of many possible outputs.

Decoders often include an **Enable input (E)**. When the Enable is asserted (e.g., set to HIGH), the decoder operates normally. When it is de-asserted (e.g., LOW), all outputs are forced to an inactive state (e.g., all LOW), regardless of the input code. This feature is crucial for controlling the decoder's timing and for cascading multiple decoders to create larger ones.

**What to look for:** A rectangular block with `n` input lines (A₀, A₁, ...), up to 2ⁿ output lines (Y₀, Y₁, ...), and an "Enable" input (E).

### 1.2 Types of Decoders

#### 2-to-4 Decoder
This decoder converts a 2-bit input (A₁, A₀) into one of four active outputs (Y₃ to Y₀).

*   **Truth Table (with Active-High Enable):**
| E  | A₁ | A₀ | Y₃ | Y₂ | Y₁ | Y₀ | Description |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-------------|
| 0  | X  | X  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | Decoder is disabled |
| 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | Output Y₀ is active for input 00 |
| 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | Output Y₁ is active for input 01 |
| 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | Output Y₂ is active for input 10 |
| 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | Output Y₃ is active for input 11 |

*   **Boolean Expressions:** Each output corresponds to one minterm of the inputs.
    *   `Y₀ = E · A₁' · A₀'`
    *   `Y₁ = E · A₁' · A₀`
    *   `Y₂ = E · A₁ · A₀'`
    *   `Y₃ = E · A₁ · A₀`

*   **Logic Circuit:**
[Click here for a diagram of a 2-to-4 decoder logic circuit](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=2-to-4+decoder+with+enable+logic+circuit)
**What to look for:** Four 3-input AND gates. Each gate is connected to the Enable line and the appropriate combination of inputs A₁/A₁' and A₀/A₀'.

#### 3-to-8 Decoder (Binary-to-Octal Decoder)
A 3-to-8 decoder has three input lines (A₂, A₁, A₀) and eight output lines (Y₇ to Y₀). It is commonly used to select one of eight devices or memory locations.

*   **Logic:** The decoder generates all eight minterms for the 3-variable input.
    *   `Y₀ = A₂' · A₁' · A₀'`
    *   `Y₁ = A₂' · A₁' · A₀`
    *   ...and so on, up to...
    *   `Y₇ = A₂ · A₁ · A₀`

*   **Logic Circuit:**
[Click here for a diagram of a 3-to-8 decoder logic circuit](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=3-to-8+decoder+logic+circuit)
**What to look for:** Eight 3-input AND gates, each corresponding to one of the eight possible minterms of the inputs A₂, A₁, and A₀.

#### 4-to-16 Decoder
A 4-to-16 decoder has four input lines (A₃ to A₀) and sixteen output lines (Y₁₅ to Y₀). This can be built using smaller decoders.

*   **Construction using two 3-to-8 Decoders:**
    A larger decoder can be built from smaller ones by using the most significant input bit to enable the correct block.
    1.  Use two 3-to-8 decoders.
    2.  The lower three input bits (A₂, A₁, A₀) are connected in parallel to the inputs of both decoders.
    3.  The most significant bit (A₃) is used as a selector. It is connected directly to the Enable pin of one decoder (which will handle outputs Y₈ to Y₁₅) and through a NOT gate to the Enable pin of the other decoder (which will handle Y₀ to Y₇).
    4.  When A₃=0, the first decoder is active, selecting an output from Y₀-Y₇. When A₃=1, the second decoder is active, selecting an output from Y₈-Y₁₅.

[Click here for a diagram of a 4-to-16 decoder using two 3-to-8 decoders](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=4-to-16+decoder+using+3-to-8+decoders)
**What to look for:** Two 3-to-8 decoder blocks. The A₂, A₁, A₀ inputs go to both. The A₃ input controls which decoder is enabled.

### 1.3 Implementing Logic Functions with Decoders

A decoder is a "minterm generator." This property makes it incredibly useful for implementing any combinational logic function directly from its Sum of Products (SOP) form.

**Example from Notes:** Implement `Y = Σm(1, 2, 4, 7)` using a 3-to-8 decoder.
1.  **Select Decoder:** The function has 3 variables (A, B, C), so a 3-to-8 decoder is required. The variables A, B, and C will be the inputs to the decoder.
2.  **Identify Minterms:** The function requires the sum of minterms 1, 2, 4, and 7.
3.  **Combine Outputs:** The decoder's outputs Y₁, Y₂, Y₄, and Y₇ correspond to these minterms. These specific output lines are connected to the inputs of a 4-input OR gate. The output of the OR gate is the desired function Y.

**What to look for:** A 3-to-8 decoder block with inputs A, B, C. The specific output lines (in this case, 1, 2, 4, 7) are connected as inputs to an OR gate.

## 2. BCD to Seven-Segment Decoder

### 2.1 Introduction

A **seven-segment display** is a common device for displaying decimal digits (0-9). It consists of seven segments (LEDs) arranged in a figure-8 pattern, labeled `a` through `g`. A **BCD to seven-segment decoder** is a special-purpose combinational circuit that takes a 4-bit BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) input and generates the 7-bit output required to light the correct segments for the corresponding decimal digit.

[Click here for a diagram of a seven-segment display layout](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=seven+segment+display+segment+labels)
**What to look for:** The figure-8 arrangement with segments clearly labeled a, b, c, d, e, f, g.

### 2.2 Common Cathode vs. Common Anode

*   **Common Cathode:** All cathodes of the 7 LEDs are connected to a common ground (GND). A segment is turned ON by applying a HIGH (logic 1) signal to its anode. This is an **active-high** configuration.
*   **Common Anode:** All anodes of the 7 LEDs are connected to a common power supply (Vcc). A segment is turned ON by applying a LOW (logic 0) signal to its cathode. This is an **active-low** configuration.

The internal logic of the decoder IC must match the type of display being used.

### 2.3 Design for a Common Cathode Display

The design process involves creating a truth table that maps each 4-bit BCD input to the seven segment outputs.

**Truth Table (Active-High Outputs):**

| Decimal | BCD Input (B₃B₂B₁B₀) | a | b | c | d | e | f | g |
|---------|------------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0       | 0000                   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1       | 0001                   | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2       | 0010                   | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 3       | 0011                   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 4       | 0100                   | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 5       | 0101                   | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 6       | 0110                   | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 7       | 0111                   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 8       | 1000                   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 9       | 1001                   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 10-15   | 1010 - 1111            | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |

*Note: Since BCD is only valid for digits 0-9, the input combinations for 10 through 15 are invalid. These are treated as **"Don't Cares" (X)**, which is very useful for simplifying the logic expressions when using K-maps.*

To derive the circuit, a separate 4-variable K-map is created for each of the seven segment outputs (a-g). The simplified Boolean expressions are then implemented with logic gates. In practice, this complex circuit is encapsulated in a single IC, like the **7447** (active-low outputs for common anode) or **7448** (active-high outputs for common cathode).

**What to look for:** A block representing the decoder IC, with 4 BCD inputs and 7 segment outputs connected to the corresponding pins of a seven-segment display.
