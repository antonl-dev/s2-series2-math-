# 3.2.e Encoders (Expanded)

## 1. Introduction to Encoders

An **encoder** is a combinational logic circuit that performs the reverse operation of a decoder. It converts a set of active input signals into a coded binary output. An encoder has a large number of input lines (up to 2ⁿ) and a smaller number of output lines (n).

The primary function of an encoder is to generate a unique binary code that corresponds to which one of its input lines is active (held at a HIGH state). Simple encoders operate under the assumption that only one input line is active at any given time.

**Key Applications:**
*   **Keypads:** Converting a key press (e.g., decimal digits 0-9) into a binary code (e.g., BCD) that a microprocessor or digital system can understand.
*   **Interrupt Controllers:** In a computer, multiple devices can request an interrupt. A priority encoder can identify which device has the highest priority and provide its unique ID to the CPU.

**What to look for:** A rectangular block with 2ⁿ input lines (labeled I₀, I₁, etc.) and n output lines (labeled Y₀, Y₁, etc.).

## 2. Standard Encoder Designs ("Simple Encoders")

These encoders assume that one and only one input is active at any time.

### 2.1 4-to-2 Encoder
A 4-to-2 encoder has four input lines (I₃, I₂, I₁, I₀) and two output lines (Y₁, Y₀).

*   **Truth Table:**
| I₃ | I₂ | I₁ | I₀ | Y₁ | Y₀ | Description |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|-------------|
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | Input 0 is active, output is binary 00 |
| 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  | Input 1 is active, output is binary 01 |
| 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | Input 2 is active, output is binary 10 |
| 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | Input 3 is active, output is binary 11 |

*   **Boolean Expressions:**
    *   `Y₀ = I₁ + I₃`
    *   `Y₁ = I₂ + I₃`

*   **Logic Circuit:**
[Click here for a diagram of a 4-to-2 encoder logic circuit](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=4-to-2+encoder+logic+circuit+using+or+gates)
**What to look for:** Two OR gates. One gate for Y₀ with inputs I₁ and I₃. The other gate for Y₁ with inputs I₂ and I₃.

### 2.2 8-to-3 Encoder (Octal-to-Binary Encoder)
An 8-to-3 encoder converts an active octal input (one of eight lines, I₇ to I₀) to its 3-bit binary equivalent (Y₂, Y₁, Y₀).

*   **Truth Table Summary:**
    If input I₀ is active, output is 000.
    If input I₁ is active, output is 001.
    ...
    If input I₇ is active, output is 111.

*   **Boolean Expressions:**
    *   `Y₀ = I₁ + I₃ + I₅ + I₇` (Y₀ is 1 for odd-numbered inputs)
    *   `Y₁ = I₂ + I₃ + I₆ + I₇` (Y₁ is 1 for inputs 2, 3, 6, 7)
    *   `Y₂ = I₄ + I₅ + I₆ + I₇` (Y₂ is 1 for inputs 4, 5, 6, 7)

*   **Logic Circuit:**
[Click here for a diagram of an 8-to-3 encoder logic circuit](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=8-to-3+encoder+logic+circuit)
**What to look for:** Three multi-input OR gates implementing the expressions above.

## 3. Priority Encoders

Simple encoders have two major limitations:
1.  **Ambiguity:** If more than one input is active, the output is incorrect. For a 4-to-2 encoder, if I₁ and I₂ are both HIGH, the output is `Y₁Y₀ = 11`, which wrongly implies that I₃ is active.
2.  **Zero State:** There is no way to distinguish between the "I₀ is active" state and the "no input is active" state. Both can produce an output of all zeros.

A **Priority Encoder** solves these problems by:
1.  Establishing a **priority** level for each input. If multiple inputs are active, the output code corresponds to the input with the **highest priority**.
2.  Providing an additional output, often called "Valid" (V) or "Group Select" (GS), to indicate if **any** input is active.

### 3.1 4-to-2 Priority Encoder
In a 4-to-2 priority encoder, let's establish that I₃ has the highest priority, followed by I₂, I₁, and I₀ (lowest).

*   **Truth Table:**
    (X = Don't Care)
| I₃ | I₂ | I₁ | I₀ | Y₁ | Y₀ | V (Valid) | Description |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----------|-------------|
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | X  | X  | 0         | No input is active. Outputs are irrelevant. |
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1         | Only I₀ is active. |
| 0  | 0  | 1  | X  | 0  | 1  | 1         | I₁ is active. The state of lower-priority I₀ does not matter. |
| 0  | 1  | X  | X  | 1  | 0  | 1         | I₂ is active. The states of I₁ and I₀ do not matter. |
| 1  | X  | X  | X  | 1  | 1  | 1         | I₃ is active. All other inputs are ignored due to its high priority. |

*   **Logic Derivation (using K-maps):**
    From the truth table, we can create K-maps for Y₁, Y₀, and V.
    *   `V = I₃ + I₂ + I₁ + I₀`
    *   `Y₁ = I₃ + I₂`
    *   `Y₀ = I₃ + I₁·I₂'` (Y₀ is HIGH if I₃ is HIGH, or if I₁ is HIGH AND higher-priority I₂ is not)

*   **Logic Circuit:**
[Click here for a diagram of a 4-to-2 priority encoder logic circuit](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=4-to-2+priority+encoder+logic+circuit)
**What to look for:** A more complex circuit than the simple encoder. It will include logic (AND, NOT gates) to implement the priority rules.

### 3.2 Decimal-to-BCD Priority Encoder (10-to-4 Encoder)
This is a very common practical encoder, often found in ICs like the **74147**. It encodes 10 input lines (representing decimal digits 1 through 9, plus sometimes 0) into a 4-bit BCD output.

*   **Function:** It takes 9 active-LOW inputs (I₁' to I₉') and produces a 4-bit active-LOW BCD output (A₃', A₂', A₁', A₀').
*   **Priority:** Input I₉' has the highest priority. If I₉' is active (LOW), the output will be the BCD code for 9 (LHH L, which is 0110 in active low), regardless of any other inputs.
*   **Zero Condition:** If none of the inputs (1-9) are active, the output is typically BCD for 9 (or sometimes 0, depending on the IC). This implies a "no key pressed" state.

[Click here for a diagram of the 74147 Decimal-to-BCD Priority Encoder IC](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=74147+priority+encoder+logic+symbol)
**What to look for:** An IC block with 9 inputs (1-9) and 4 outputs (A,B,C,D or A₃,A₂,A₁,A₀). Note that the inputs and outputs are often shown with bubbles, indicating they are active-LOW.
