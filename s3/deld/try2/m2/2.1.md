# Module 2: Boolean Algebra and Combinational Circuits Design

## 2.1 Review of Boolean Algebra

### 1. Introduction

**Boolean Algebra** is the mathematical foundation of digital logic design. It is a system of algebra in which the variables can only have two values: **TRUE (1)** or **FALSE (0)**. The primary operations are **AND (conjunction)**, **OR (disjunction)**, and **NOT (negation)**.

Every digital circuit, no matter how complex, is designed and can be simplified using the rules and theorems of Boolean algebra. The main goal of simplification is to reduce a complex logic expression into a simpler one, which results in a circuit with fewer gates, making it cheaper, faster, and more efficient.

### 2. Postulates and Basic Identities

These are the fundamental rules of Boolean algebra that are accepted without proof.

| AND Operation (`·`) | OR Operation (`+`)    | NOT Operation (`'`) |
| :------------------ | :-------------------- | :------------------ |
| `A · 0 = 0`         | `A + 0 = A`           | `A'' = A` (Involution) |
| `A · 1 = A`         | `A + 1 = 1`           |                     |
| `A · A = A`         | `A + A = A`           |                     |
| `A · A' = 0`        | `A + A' = 1`          |                     |

### 3. Theorems and Laws of Boolean Algebra

These theorems are derived from the postulates and are used for manipulating and simplifying Boolean expressions.

*   **Commutative Law:** The order of variables does not matter.
    *   `A + B = B + A`
    *   `A · B = B · A`

*   **Associative Law:** The grouping of variables does not matter.
    *   `A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C`
    *   `A · (B · C) = (A · B) · C`

*   **Distributive Law:**
    *   `A · (B + C) = (A · B) + (A · C)`
    *   `A + (B · C) = (A + B) · (A + C)` (This second form is unique to Boolean algebra).

*   **Absorption Law:**
    *   `A + (A · B) = A`
    *   `A · (A + B) = A`

*   **Consensus Theorem:**
    *   `A·B + A'·C + B·C = A·B + A'·C`

### 4. De Morgan's Theorems

De Morgan's theorems are crucial for simplifying expressions and for converting logic functions between different forms (e.g., implementing functions with only NAND or NOR gates).

1.  **First Theorem:** The complement of a sum is equal to the product of the complements.
    ` (A + B)' = A' · B' `

2.  **Second Theorem:** The complement of a product is equal to the sum of the complements.
    ` (A · B)' = A' + B' `

A simple way to remember this is: **"Break the line, change the sign."**

> **What to look for:** A diagram showing that a NOR gate (`(A+B)'`) is functionally equivalent to an AND gate with inverted inputs (`A' · B'`). Similarly, it should show that a NAND gate (`(A·B)'`) is equivalent to an OR gate with inverted inputs (`A' + B'`).

### 5. Simplification of Boolean Expressions

We apply the laws and theorems to reduce the number of terms or literals in an expression.

**Example (from notes):** Simplify the expression `f = A(B + BC') + BC`
```
f = A(B + BC') + BC
f = AB + ABC' + BC       // Distributive Law
f = AB + BC              // Absorption Law (AB absorbs ABC')
f = B(A + C)             // Distributive Law
```
The simplified expression `B(A+C)` is much easier to implement than the original.

### 6. Universal Gates: NAND and NOR

**NAND** and **NOR** gates are called **universal gates** because any of the basic logic functions (AND, OR, NOT) can be implemented using only one type of these gates. This is a direct application of De Morgan's theorems.

#### a. Implementation using only NAND gates
*   **NOT Gate:** `A' = (A · A)'`. Tie the inputs of a NAND gate together.
*   **AND Gate:** `A · B = ((A · B)')'`. Use a NAND gate followed by a NAND inverter.
*   **OR Gate:** `A + B = (A' · B')'`. Use two NAND inverters on the inputs, followed by a NAND gate.

> **What to look for:** Three separate diagrams showing the connections for creating a NOT, an AND, and an OR gate using only 2-input NAND gates.

#### b. Implementation using only NOR gates
*   **NOT Gate:** `A' = (A + A)'`. Tie the inputs of a NOR gate together.
*   **OR Gate:** `A + B = ((A + B)')'`. Use a NOR gate followed by a NOR inverter.
*   **AND Gate:** `A · B = (A' + B')'`. Use two NOR inverters on the inputs, followed by a NOR gate.
