## 2.2 Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS)

Boolean expressions can be written in two standard or "canonical" forms: the Sum of Products (SOP) form and the Product of Sums (POS) form. These standard forms are essential for simplifying logic circuits and are used directly in tools like Karnaugh maps.

### 1. Minterms and Sum of Products (SOP)

*   **Product Term:** A term where variables are ANDed together (e.g., `A·B`, `A'·B·C`).
*   **Minterm:** A special product term that contains **all** the variables of the function, either in their normal or complemented form. A minterm evaluates to `1` for only **one unique combination** of input variables.
*   **Sum of Products (SOP) Form:** An expression formed by ORing two or more product terms.
*   **Canonical SOP Form:** An expression formed by ORing the **minterms** for which the function's output is `1`.

#### Deriving Canonical SOP from a Truth Table

For a function of `n` variables, there are `2^n` possible minterms.

**Example for 3 variables (A, B, C):**

| A | B | C | Minterm Designation | Minterm Term |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-------------------:|:------------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |         `m₀`        |   `A'B'C'`   |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |         `m₁`        |    `A'B'C`   |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |         `m₂`        |    `A'BC'`   |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |         `m₃`        |     `A'BC`   |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |         `m₄`        |    `AB'C'`   |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |         `m₅`        |     `AB'C`   |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |         `m₆`        |     `ABC'`   |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |         `m₇`        |      `ABC`   |

To write a function in canonical SOP form, you identify all the rows in the truth table where the output is `1` and sum (OR) their corresponding minterms.

**Shorthand Notation:** The sum of minterms is represented using the sigma (`Σ`) symbol.
`F(A,B,C) = Σm(1, 4, 6)` is shorthand for `F = m₁ + m₄ + m₆ = A'B'C + AB'C' + ABC'`.

### 2. Maxterms and Product of Sums (POS)

*   **Sum Term:** A term where variables are ORed together (e.g., `A+B`, `A'+B+C`).
*   **Maxterm:** A special sum term that contains **all** the variables of the function. A maxterm evaluates to `0` for only **one unique combination** of input variables.
*   **Product of Sums (POS) Form:** An expression formed by ANDing two or more sum terms.
*   **Canonical POS Form:** An expression formed by ANDing the **maxterms** for which the function's output is `0`.

#### Deriving Canonical POS from a Truth Table

**Example for 3 variables (A, B, C):**

| A | B | C | Maxterm Designation | Maxterm Term |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-------------------:|:------------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |         `M₀`        |    `A+B+C`   |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |         `M₁`        |   `A+B+C'`   |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |         `M₂`        |   `A+B'+C`   |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |         `M₃`        |  `A+B'+C'`   |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |         `M₄`        |   `A'+B+C`   |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |         `M₅`        |  `A'+B+C'`   |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |         `M₆`        |  `A'+B'+C`   |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |         `M₇`        | `A'+B'+C'`  |

To write a function in canonical POS form, you identify all the rows in the truth table where the output is `0` and multiply (AND) their corresponding maxterms.

**Shorthand Notation:** The product of maxterms is represented using the pi (`Π`) symbol.
`F(A,B,C) = ΠM(0, 2, 3, 5, 7)` is shorthand for `F = M₀ · M₂ · M₃ · M₅ · M₇ = (A+B+C)(A+B'+C)(A+B'+C')...`

> **What to look for:** A table with columns for A, B, C, the minterm number (`mᵢ`), the minterm expression, the maxterm number (`Mᵢ`), and the maxterm expression. This clearly shows the complementary relationship.

### 3. Relationship and Conversion between SOP and POS

For any given function, the set of minterms and the set of maxterms are complementary. If you know one, you can find the other.

*   If `F = Σm(1, 4, 6)`, the output is `1` for rows 1, 4, and 6. This implies the output must be `0` for all other rows (0, 2, 3, 5, 7).
*   Therefore, the POS form is `F = ΠM(0, 2, 3, 5, 7)`.

**To convert from SOP to POS:**
Identify the minterm indices. The maxterm indices will be all the numbers that are missing from the minterm list.

**To convert from POS to SOP:**
Identify the maxterm indices. The minterm indices will be all the numbers that are missing from the maxterm list.

### 4. Standard (Canonical) vs. Non-Standard (Normal) Forms

*   **Canonical Form:** Every term (minterm or maxterm) contains **all** variables of the function.
    *   Example: `F = A'BC + AB'C`
*   **Normal (or Simplified) Form:** The terms in the expression do not necessarily contain all variables. This is usually the result of Boolean simplification.
    *   Example: `F = A'B + AC'`

To convert a normal form to a canonical SOP form, you must expand each term by ANDing it with `(X + X')` for every missing variable `X`.
**Example:** Convert `F = A + BC'` to 3-variable canonical SOP.
1.  Term `A` is missing B and C.
    `A = A·(B+B') = AB + AB'`
    `AB = AB(C+C') = ABC + ABC'`
    `AB' = AB'(C+C') = AB'C + AB'C'`
2.  Term `BC'` is missing A.
    `BC' = BC'(A+A') = ABC' + A'BC'`
3.  Combine and remove duplicates:
    `F = ABC + ABC' + AB'C + AB'C' + A'BC'`
    `F = Σm(7, 6, 5, 4, 2)`
