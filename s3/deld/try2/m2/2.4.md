# Module 2: Boolean Algebra and Combinational Circuits Design

## 2.4 Half Adder, Full Adder, Half Subtractor, and Full Subtractor

Adders and subtractors are essential combinational logic circuits that perform arithmetic operations. They are the core components of a computer's Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

### 1. Half Adder

A **Half Adder** is a combinational circuit that performs the addition of **two single binary digits**. It has two inputs (A and B) and two outputs: **Sum (S)** and **Carry (C)**.

#### Truth Table and Expressions

| A | B | Sum (S) | Carry (C) |
|:-:|:-:|:-------:|:---------:|
| 0 | 0 |    0    |     0     |
| 0 | 1 |    1    |     0     |
| 1 | 0 |    1    |     0     |
| 1 | 1 |    0    |     1     |

From the truth table, we can derive the Boolean expressions:
*   The **Sum (S)** column is the output of an XOR gate.
    `S = A'B + AB' = A ⊕ B`
*   The **Carry (C)** column is the output of an AND gate.
    `C = A · B`

#### Logic Circuit Diagram

The circuit is implemented directly from these expressions.

> **What to look for:** A circuit with two inputs, A and B. One XOR gate produces the Sum (S), and one AND gate produces the Carry (C).

### 2. Full Adder

A Half Adder is limited because it cannot accept a carry-in from a previous stage of addition. A **Full Adder** solves this by adding **three single binary digits**: A, B, and a Carry-in (Cᵢₙ). It produces two outputs: **Sum (S)** and **Carry-out (Cₒᵤₜ)**.

#### Truth Table and Expressions

| A | B | Cᵢₙ | Sum (S) | Cₒᵤₜ |
|:-:|:-:|:---:|:-------:|:-----:|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |    0    |   0   |
| 0 | 0 |  1  |    1    |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |    1    |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |    0    |   1   |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |    1    |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |    0    |   1   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |    0    |   1   |
| 1 | 1 |  1  |    1    |   1   |

From the truth table or K-maps, we derive the expressions:
*   **Sum (S):** `S = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cᵢₙ`
*   **Carry-out (Cₒᵤₜ):** `Cₒᵤₜ = A·B + B·Cᵢₙ + A·Cᵢₙ` or `Cₒᵤₜ = A·B + Cᵢₙ(A ⊕ B)`

#### Logic Circuit Implementations

A Full Adder can be implemented in two common ways:

**1. Using Basic Logic Gates (from K-map expressions):**
This uses multiple AND gates and an OR gate for the carry, and XOR gates for the sum.

**2. Using Two Half Adders (as shown in your notes):**
This is a very common and insightful design.
*   The first Half Adder adds A and B, producing a temporary sum (S₁) and carry (C₁).
*   The second Half Adder adds the temporary sum (S₁) and the Carry-in (Cᵢₙ), producing the final Sum (S).
*   The final Carry-out (Cₒᵤₜ) is produced by ORing the carries from both Half Adders (C₁ and C₂).

### 3. Half Subtractor

A **Half Subtractor** is a combinational circuit that subtracts **two single binary digits**. It has two inputs (A, B) and two outputs: **Difference (D)** and **Borrow (Bₒ)**. It performs the operation `A - B`.

#### Truth Table and Expressions

| A | B | Difference (D) | Borrow (Bₒ) |
|:-:|:-:|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| 0 | 0 |        0       |      0      |
| 0 | 1 |        1       |      1      | (0-1 requires a borrow)
| 1 | 0 |        1       |      0      |
| 1 | 1 |        0       |      0      |

From the truth table, we derive the expressions:
*   **Difference (D):** `D = A ⊕ B`
*   **Borrow (Bₒ):** `Bₒ = A' · B`

> **What to look for:** A circuit with inputs A and B. An XOR gate produces the Difference. An AND gate with input A inverted (`A'`) and input B produces the Borrow.

### 4. Full Subtractor

A **Full Subtractor** subtracts **three single binary digits**: A, B, and a Borrow-in (Bᵢₙ). It produces a **Difference (D)** and a **Borrow-out (Bₒᵤₜ)**. It performs `A - B - Bᵢₙ`.

#### Truth Table and Expressions

| A | B | Bᵢₙ | Difference (D) | Bₒᵤₜ |
|:-:|:-:|:---:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |        0       |   0   |
| 0 | 0 |  1  |        1       |   1   |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |        1       |   1   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |        0       |   1   |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |        1       |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |        0       |   0   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |        0       |   0   |
| 1 | 1 |  1  |        1       |   1   |

From the truth table, we derive the expressions:
*   **Difference (D):** `D = A ⊕ B ⊕ Bᵢₙ`
*   **Borrow-out (Bₒᵤₜ):** `Bₒᵤₜ = A'·B + A'·Bᵢₙ + B·Bᵢₙ`
