# MODULE 4: Answer Key

### Section 4.1: Introduction to Flip-Flops – SR Flip-Flop

1.  **Combinational vs. Sequential:**
    *   A **combinational** circuit's output depends solely on its current inputs (e.g., an adder, a decoder).
    *   A **sequential** circuit's output depends on both current inputs and its past states, because it contains memory elements (e.g., a counter, a register).
2.  **Flip-Flop:** A flip-flop is an electronic circuit that can store a single bit of binary data. It is "bistable" because it has two stable states (Q=0 and Q=1) and will remain in one of these states until triggered to change.
3.  **SR Flip-Flop (NAND gates):**
    [Click here for the circuit diagram](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=SR+flip+flop+using+NAND+gates+circuit)
    **Description:** It uses four NAND gates. The S, R, and CLK inputs feed a pair of gates, which in turn feed a cross-coupled pair of gates to produce the Q and Q' outputs.
4.  **SR CLK Inputs:**
    *   **S (Set):** When active (S=1, R=0) during a clock trigger, it forces the Q output to 1.
    *   **R (Reset):** When active (S=0, R=1) during a clock trigger, it forces the Q output to 0.
    *   **CLK (Clock):** This is the synchronizing signal. The flip-flop only responds to the S and R inputs at a specific instant determined by the clock (e.g., its rising or falling edge).
5.  **Invalid State (S=1, R=1):** This condition tries to set and reset the flip-flop simultaneously. In a NAND gate implementation, this forces both Q and Q' outputs to become 1, which violates the fundamental rule that Q' must be the complement of Q. The final state is unpredictable when the inputs are removed.
6.  **Preset and Clear:** They are asynchronous inputs that override the clock and synchronous inputs (S, R). `PRESET` forces Q=1 and `CLEAR` forces Q=0 immediately, making them useful for initializing a circuit to a known state.
7.  **SR Excitation Table:** It shows the required inputs (S, R) to achieve a desired state transition from `Qn` to `Qn+1`. It's used in reverse engineering or designing circuits where you know the required output sequence.
    *   0→0: S=0, R=X
    *   0→1: S=1, R=0
    *   1→0: S=0, R=1
    *   1→1: S=X, R=0

### Section 4.2: JK and D Flip-Flops

8.  **JK Advantage:** The JK flip-flop eliminates the "invalid" state of the SR flip-flop. The input condition J=1, K=1 is given a useful function: the toggle state.
9.  **Toggle Condition:** The output toggles (inverts its state) when `J=1` and `K=1` and a clock pulse occurs. If Q was 0, it becomes 1; if it was 1, it becomes 0.
10. **JK Tables:**
    *   **Truth Table:** J=0,K=0 (Hold); J=0,K=1 (Reset); J=1,K=0 (Set); J=1,K=1 (Toggle).
    *   **Excitation Table:** 0→0 (J=0,K=X); 0→1 (J=1,K=X); 1→0 (J=X,K=1); 1→1 (J=X,K=0).
11. **D Flip-Flop:** Its main application is for data storage and creating buffer registers. It's called a "Delay" flip-flop because the data at input D is only transferred to output Q after a delay of one clock cycle.
12. **D from JK:** Connect the `D` input line directly to the `J` input. Connect the `D` input line through a NOT gate to the `K` input.
13. **D Tables:**
    *   **Truth Table:** Qn+1 = D. If D=0, Q becomes 0. If D=1, Q becomes 1.
    *   **Excitation Table:** 0→0 (D=0); 0→1 (D=1); 1→0 (D=0); 1→1 (D=1).
14. **Triggering:**
    *   **Edge-triggering:** The state change happens only at the instant of a clock transition (rising or falling edge).
    *   **Level-triggering:** The output can change at any time while the clock is at its active level (HIGH or LOW).
    *   Edge-triggering is preferred in synchronous systems because it ensures that all state changes happen at a single, precise moment, preventing timing errors and race conditions.

### Section 4.3: T Flip-Flop, JK Master-Slave, and Conversions

15. **T Flip-Flop:** Its primary application is in frequency division and binary counters. When T=1, the output waveform has exactly half the frequency of the input clock signal.
16. **T from JK:** Simply connect the J and K inputs together. This common line becomes the T input.
17. **Race-Around Condition:** Occurs in a level-triggered JK flip-flop when J=1, K=1, and the clock pulse duration is longer than the flip-flop's propagation delay. The output may toggle multiple times during one clock pulse, resulting in an unpredictable final state.
18. **Master-Slave Operation:** It's a two-stage process. On the clock's leading edge, the master flip-flop accepts the J and K inputs while the slave is isolated. On the clock's trailing edge, the master is isolated, and the slave copies the state from the master. This ensures the output can only change once per full clock cycle, preventing the race-around condition.
19. **D to T Conversion:**
    *   Logic needed: `D = T ⊕ Qn` (D is the XOR of T and the present state Q).
    *   Circuit: Connect the T input and the Q output to an XOR gate. The output of the XOR gate is connected to the D input of the flip-flop.
20. **SR to JK Conversion:**
    *   Logic needed: `S = J · Qn'` and `R = K · Qn`.
    *   Circuit: Use two AND gates. One takes inputs J and Q' and feeds S. The other takes inputs K and Q and feeds R.
21. **SR to T Conversion:**
    *   Logic needed: `S = T · Qn'` and `R = T · Qn`.
    *   Circuit: Similar to the JK conversion, but J and K are tied together to form the T input.

### Section 4.4: Asynchronous Counters

22. **Asynchronous vs. Synchronous:** In an asynchronous counter, the flip-flops are not clocked simultaneously; the output of one triggers the next. In a synchronous counter, all flip-flops are triggered by a common clock signal.
23. **Ripple Counter:** Asynchronous counters are called ripple counters because the state change propagates or "ripples" through the chain of flip-flops one by one, creating a delay.
24. **Asynchronous Pros/Cons:**
    *   **Advantage:** Simple design, uses minimal hardware.
    *   **Disadvantage:** Slow due to cumulative propagation delay, which limits the max clock frequency. Can also produce temporary invalid states (glitches) during transitions.
25. **4-bit Async Up Counter (T-FF):** Four T flip-flops. All T inputs are tied HIGH. External clock drives the first FF. The Q output of each FF drives the clock input of the next.
26. **3-bit Async Up Counter:** See section 4.4 notes for the full circuit and timing diagram. It uses three JK flip-flops in toggle mode, with the Q output of each driving the clock of the next.
27. **Down Counter Modification:** To convert an up counter to a down counter, you take the clocking signal for the subsequent flip-flop from the inverted output (`Q'`) instead of the normal output (`Q`).
28. **Modulus / MOD-12:** The modulus is the number of states in a count sequence. To build a MOD-12 counter, you need `n` flip-flops such that 2ⁿ ≥ 12. `2³=8` (too small), `2⁴=16` (sufficient). So, **4 flip-flops** are required.
29. **MOD-6 Design:** Use 3 flip-flops (2³=8 ≥ 6). The counter should reset when it reaches the state for decimal 6 (`110`). Connect Q₂ and Q₁ to a NAND gate. Connect the NAND gate's output to the active-low CLEAR inputs of all three flip-flops.

### Section 4.5: Synchronous Counters

30. **Synchronous Advantage:** They are much faster because all flip-flops change state simultaneously. The maximum operating frequency is determined by the delay of just one flip-flop and its associated logic, not the sum of all delays.
31. **Synchronous Design Steps:** 1. Create State Diagram/Table. 2. Choose Flip-Flop Type. 3. Create Excitation Table. 4. Simplify input logic using K-Maps. 5. Draw the final circuit.
32. **Excitation Table Purpose:** It is essential for determining the combinational logic required for the synchronous inputs (J, K, D, or T) of each flip-flop to produce the desired sequence of states.
33. **2-bit Sync Up Counter (T-FF):**
    *   Logic: `T₀ = 1`, `T₁ = Q₀`.
    *   Circuit: Two T flip-flops with a common clock. T₀ is tied to HIGH. The Q₀ output is connected to the T₁ input.
34. **Max Clock Frequency:** Determined by the propagation delay of one flip-flop plus the propagation delay of the combinational logic gates in the path of the synchronous inputs. `f_max = 1 / (t_pd_ff + t_pd_gates)`.

### Section 4.6: Shift Registers, Ring & Johnson Counters

35. **Shift Register & Types:** A register that shifts binary data. The four types are: SISO (Serial-In, Serial-Out), SIPO (Serial-In, Parallel-Out), PISO (Parallel-In, Serial-Out), and PIPO (Parallel-In, Parallel-Out).
36. **Serial to Parallel:** A **SIPO** register is used for this conversion.
37. **SHIFT/LOAD Control:** A **PISO** register needs this control line to switch between two modes: loading all bits at once in parallel, and shifting the bits out one by one serially.
38. **Ring Counter / States:** A shift register with the last output fed back to the first input. A 5-bit ring counter has **5** states.
39. **4-bit Ring Counter:** See section 4.6 notes for the circuit and timing diagram. It's a 4-bit shift register with Q₃ connected to D₀. The timing diagram shows a single '1' bit circulating through the four outputs.
40. **Johnson Counter:** A modified ring counter where the *inverted* output (Q') of the last stage is fed back to the first input. This doubles the number of states compared to a standard ring counter.
41. **5-bit Johnson Counter States:** A 5-bit Johnson counter has `2N = 2 * 5 =` **10** states.
42. **3-bit Johnson Counter Sequence:** Starting from 000:
    `000 → 100 → 110 → 111 → 011 → 001 → 000` (6 states).
