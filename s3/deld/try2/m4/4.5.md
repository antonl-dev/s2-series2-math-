## 4.5 Synchronous Counters design using flipflops

### 1. Introduction to Synchronous Counters

Synchronous counters are a significant improvement over their asynchronous counterparts. Their key defining feature is that all the flip-flops in the counter are triggered by the **same clock signal simultaneously**.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Simultaneous Clocking:** A common clock pulse is applied to the CLK input of every flip-flop.
*   **Faster Operation:** Since all flip-flops change state at the same time, the total propagation delay is just the delay of a single flip-flop plus the delay of any logic gates used. This allows for much higher operating frequencies compared to ripple counters.
*   **More Complex Design:** The logic required to control *when* a flip-flop should toggle is more complex. This control logic is connected to the synchronous inputs (like J and K) of the flip-flops.

**What to look for:** A diagram showing the clock signal "rippling" through the flip-flops in an asynchronous counter, versus a diagram where a single clock line connects to all flip-flops in a synchronous counter.

### 2. Design of Synchronous Counters

Designing a synchronous counter is a systematic process that involves determining the logic required for each flip-flop's inputs (J, K, D, or T) to produce a desired count sequence.

#### **General Design Procedure:**

1.  **State Diagram/Table:**
    *   Clearly define the desired count sequence.
    *   Draw a **state diagram** showing the progression of states.
    *   Create a **state table (or transition table)** that lists the *Present State* of the flip-flops and the corresponding *Next State* for each clock pulse.

2.  **Flip-Flop Selection:**
    *   Choose the type of flip-flop you will use for the design (e.g., JK, T, or D).

3.  **Excitation Table:**
    *   Create the **excitation table** for the counter. This table expands the state table to include the required flip-flop inputs (the "excitations") needed to achieve each transition from a present state to a next state.
    *   To fill this part of the table, you use the standard excitation table for the chosen flip-flop type (e.g., the JK excitation table).

4.  **K-Map Simplification:**
    *   For each flip-flop input (e.g., J₀, K₀, J₁, K₁, etc.), create a Karnaugh map (K-map).
    *   The K-map inputs are the present state bits (Q₂, Q₁, Q₀, etc.), and the map is filled with the values from the excitation table.
    *   Derive the simplified Boolean expression for each flip-flop input.

5.  **Circuit Implementation:**
    *   Draw the final logic circuit. This involves connecting the flip-flops to the common clock and implementing the simplified Boolean expressions using logic gates to drive the J, K, D, or T inputs.

#### 2.1 Example: Design a 3-Bit Synchronous Up Counter using JK Flip-Flops

**Goal:** Design a counter that sequences from 000 → 001 → ... → 111 and repeats.

1.  **State Table:** The outputs are Q₂, Q₁, Q₀.

| Present State (Qn) | Next State (Qn+1) |
| :---: | :---: |
| Q₂ Q₁ Q₀ | Q₂ Q₁ Q₀ |
| 0 0 0 | 0 0 1 |
| 0 0 1 | 0 1 0 |
| 0 1 0 | 0 1 1 |
| 0 1 1 | 1 0 0 |
| 1 0 0 | 1 0 1 |
| 1 0 1 | 1 1 0 |
| 1 1 0 | 1 1 1 |
| 1 1 1 | 0 0 0 |

2.  **Excitation Table (using JK Flip-Flop):** We analyze each bit's transition (e.g., for Q₀, it goes 0→1, 1→0, etc.) and determine the required J₀ and K₀ values.

| Q₂ | Q₁ | Q₀ | Q₂⁺ | Q₁⁺ | Q₀⁺ | **J₂ K₂** | **J₁ K₁** | **J₀ K₀** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 X | 0 X | 1 X |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 X | 1 X | X 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 X | X 0 | 1 X |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 X | X 1 | X 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | X 0 | 0 X | 1 X |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | X 0 | 1 X | X 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | X 0 | X 0 | 1 X |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | X 1 | X 1 | X 1 |

3.  **K-Map Simplification:**
    *   **For J₀, K₀:** The columns for J₀ and K₀ are always `1` or `X`. This simplifies to **J₀ = 1** and **K₀ = 1**. (FF0 always toggles).
    *   **For J₁, K₁:** A K-map for J₁ gives the expression **J₁ = Q₀**. A K-map for K₁ gives **K₁ = Q₀**.
    *   **For J₂, K₂:** A K-map for J₂ gives **J₂ = Q₁·Q₀**. A K-map for K₂ gives **K₂ = Q₁·Q₀**.

4.  **Circuit Implementation:**
    *   Connect the CLK inputs of all three JK flip-flops to a common clock signal.
    *   For FF0: Connect `J₀` and `K₀` to HIGH (Logic 1).
    *   For FF1: Connect `J₁` and `K₁` to the `Q₀` output.
    *   For FF2: Connect `Q₁` and `Q₀` to an AND gate. Connect the output of this AND gate to both `J₂` and `K₂`.

**What to look for:** Three JK flip-flops with a common clock. The J and K inputs of the second and third flip-flops are driven by logic gates (or direct connections) based on the outputs of the preceding flip-flops.
