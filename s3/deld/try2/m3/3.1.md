# 3.1 Introduction to Comparators, Parity Generators and Checkers

## 1. Digital Comparators (Magnitude Comparators)

### 1.1 Introduction

A **digital comparator**, also known as a **magnitude comparator**, is a combinational logic circuit that compares the magnitudes of two binary numbers and determines their relationship. For two n-bit binary numbers, A and B, the circuit generates three outputs:
*   `A > B` (A is Greater than B)
*   `A < B` (A is Less than B)
*   `A = B` (A is Equal to B)

Only one of these three outputs can be HIGH at any given time.

**What to look for:** A rectangular block with two n-bit inputs (A and B) and three single-bit outputs labeled A>B, A=B, and A<B.

### 1.2 1-Bit Magnitude Comparator

Let's start with the simplest case: comparing two single-bit numbers, A and B.

**Truth Table:**

The relationship can be determined by examining the four possible input combinations.

| A | B | A > B (G) | A = B (E) | A < B (L) |
|---|---|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 0 | 0 | 0         | 1         | 0         |
| 0 | 1 | 0         | 0         | 1         |
| 1 | 0 | 1         | 0         | 0         |
| 1 | 1 | 0         | 1         | 0         |

**Boolean Expressions:**

From the truth table, we can derive the Boolean expressions for each output:

*   **A > B (G):** The output is 1 only when A=1 and B=0.
    `G = A · B'`
*   **A < B (L):** The output is 1 only when A=0 and B=1.
    `L = A' · B`
*   **A = B (E):** The output is 1 when A=0, B=0 and when A=1, B=1. This is the definition of an XNOR gate.
    `E = A'·B' + A·B = A ⊕ B`

**Logic Circuit:**

[Click here for a diagram of a 1-bit magnitude comparator circuit](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=1-bit+magnitude+comparator+logic+circuit)
**What to look for:** A circuit with inputs A and B. The A>B output is generated by an AND gate with inputs A and NOT B. The A<B output is from an AND gate with inputs NOT A and B. The A=B output is generated by an XNOR gate.

### 1.3 2-Bit Magnitude Comparator

Now let's expand to a 2-bit comparator. Let the two numbers be A (A₁A₀) and B (B₁B₀).

The comparison logic is as follows:
*   **Equality (A = B):** A equals B if and only if both pairs of corresponding bits are equal. That is, A₁ = B₁ AND A₀ = B₀.
    `E = (A₁ ⊕ B₁) · (A₀ ⊕ B₀)`
*   **Greater Than (A > B):** A is greater than B if the most significant bit of A is greater than B's (A₁ > B₀), OR if the MSBs are equal (A₁ = B₁) and the next bit of A is greater (A₀ > B₀).
    `G = (A₁ · B₁') + (A₁ ⊕ B₁) · (A₀ · B₀')`
*   **Less Than (A < B):** A is less than B if the most significant bit of A is less than B's (A₁ < B₀), OR if the MSBs are equal (A₁ = B₁) and the next bit of A is less (A₀ < B₀).
    `L = (A₁' · B₁) + (A₁ ⊕ B₁) · (A₀' · B₀)`

The logic for a 4-bit or n-bit comparator follows the same cascading pattern, starting from the most significant bit (MSB).

[Click here for a diagram of a 2-bit magnitude comparator circuit](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=2-bit+magnitude+comparator+logic+diagram)
**What to look for:** A more complex circuit with four inputs (A₁, A₀, B₁, B₀) and three outputs. The logic should implement the Boolean expressions derived above. You may also see ICs like the **7485**, which is a 4-bit comparator.

## 2. Parity Generators and Checkers

### 2.1 Introduction to Parity

In digital communication, data can be corrupted by noise during transmission. **Parity** is a simple and widely used method for detecting single-bit errors. A **parity bit** is an extra bit added to a binary message to make the total number of 1s either **even** or **odd**.

*   **Even Parity:** The parity bit is set to 1 if the number of 1s in the data is odd, making the total number of 1s (including the parity bit) even. If the number of 1s is already even, the parity bit is 0.
*   **Odd Parity:** The parity bit is set to 1 if the number of 1s in the data is even, making the total number of 1s odd. If the number of 1s is already odd, the parity bit is 0.

The device at the sender's end that adds the parity bit is called a **Parity Generator**. The device at the receiver's end that checks the message for errors is called a **Parity Checker**.

### 2.2 Parity Generation

The core of a parity generator is the **XOR (Exclusive OR)** gate. An XOR gate with two inputs outputs a 1 if the inputs are different, which corresponds to an odd number of 1s. This property can be extended to multiple inputs.

*   For an **even parity** generator, the output parity bit is the XOR of all the data bits.
*   For an **odd parity** generator, the output parity bit is the XNOR (inverted XOR) of all the data bits.

**Example: 3-Bit Even Parity Generator**

Let the 3-bit data be B₂, B₁, B₀. We want to generate an even parity bit, P.

**Truth Table:**

| B₂ | B₁ | B₀ | Number of 1s | Parity Bit (P) |
|----|----|----|--------------|----------------|
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 0 (even)     | 0              |
| 0  | 0  | 1  | 1 (odd)      | 1              |
| 0  | 1  | 0  | 1 (odd)      | 1              |
| 0  | 1  | 1  | 2 (even)     | 0              |
| 1  | 0  | 0  | 1 (odd)      | 1              |
| 1  | 0  | 1  | 2 (even)     | 0              |
| 1  | 1  | 0  | 2 (even)     | 0              |
| 1  | 1  | 1  | 3 (odd)      | 1              |

**Boolean Expression:**
From the truth table, we can see this is a 3-input XOR function.
`P = B₂ ⊕ B₁ ⊕ B₀`

[Click here for a diagram of a 3-bit even parity generator circuit](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=3-bit+even+parity+generator+xor)
**What to look for:** A circuit with three inputs (B₂, B₁, B₀) cascaded through two XOR gates to produce a single output P.

### 2.3 Parity Checking

A parity checker circuit receives the data bits along with the parity bit. It performs the same XOR operation on all received bits (data + parity).

*   **For an even parity system:** If the checker's output is 0, there is no error (or an even number of errors, which is undetectable). If the output is 1, a single-bit error has occurred.
*   **For an odd parity system:** If the checker's output is 1, there is no error. If the output is 0, an error has occurred.

**Example: 4-Bit Odd Parity Checker**
(This corresponds to 3 data bits + 1 parity bit)

Let the received message be D₃, D₂, D₁, D₀. We need to check for an odd number of 1s. The output `ErrorCheck` should be 0 for no error (odd number of 1s) and 1 for an error (even number of 1s).

The logic required is `D₃ ⊕ D₂ ⊕ D₁ ⊕ D₀`. A 4-input XOR gate will output 1 if there is an odd number of 1s. We want the opposite for our error signal, so we can use an XNOR gate.

`ErrorCheck = D₃ ⊙ D₂ ⊙ D₁ ⊙ D₀` (Output is 1 if total number of 1s is even, indicating an error)

[Click here for a diagram of a 4-bit parity checker circuit](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=4-bit+parity+checker+xor)
**What to look for:** A circuit with four inputs (the data plus the parity bit) connected to a network of XOR gates. The final output indicates the error status.
