# 3.4.mux Multiplexers (MUX)

## 1. Introduction to Multiplexers

A **Multiplexer**, often abbreviated as **MUX**, is a combinational logic circuit also known as a **"Data Selector"**. It has multiple data input lines, a single output line, and a set of "select" lines. The purpose of the select lines is to choose which one of the data input lines is routed to the single output line.

A multiplexer with `n` select lines can select from up to 2ⁿ data input lines. This is why a MUX is often described as a "many-to-one" device.

**Analogy:** Think of a MUX as a rotary switch. The select lines control the position of the switch, connecting one of the many inputs to the single output.

**What to look for:** A block diagram with multiple data inputs (I₀, I₁, ...), a smaller number of select lines (S₀, S₁, ...), and a single output (Y).

## 2. Types of Multiplexers

### 2.1 2-to-1 MUX
This is the simplest form of a MUX. It has 2 data input lines (I₁, I₀), 1 select line (S), and 1 output line (Y).

*   **Function:**
    *   If S = 0, the output Y is connected to input I₀ (`Y = I₀`).
    *   If S = 1, the output Y is connected to input I₁ (`Y = I₁`).

*   **Truth Table:**
| S | Y   |
|---|-----|
| 0 | I₀  |
| 1 | I₁  |

*   **Boolean Expression:**
    This can be derived by expressing the function in SOP form: "Y is I₀ when S is 0, OR Y is I₁ when S is 1".
    `Y = I₀·S' + I₁·S`

*   **Logic Circuit:**

**What to look for:** Two AND gates, one OR gate, and one NOT gate. The select line S controls which AND gate is enabled, allowing either I₀ or I₁ to pass through to the OR gate.

### 2.2 4-to-1 MUX
A 4-to-1 MUX has 4 data input lines (I₃ to I₀), 2 select lines (S₁, S₀), and 1 output line (Y).

*   **Function:** The 2-bit binary value of the select lines (S₁S₀) determines which input is selected.
    *   If S₁S₀ = 00, Y = I₀.
    *   If S₁S₀ = 01, Y = I₁.
    *   If S₁S₀ = 10, Y = I₂.
    *   If S₁S₀ = 11, Y = I₃.

*   **Truth Table:**
| S₁ | S₀ | Y   |
|----|----|-----|
| 0  | 0  | I₀  |
| 0  | 1  | I₁  |
| 1  | 0  | I₂  |
| 1  | 1  | I₃  |

*   **Boolean Expression:**
    `Y = I₀·S₁'·S₀' + I₁·S₁'·S₀ + I₂·S₁·S₀' + I₃·S₁·S₀`

*   **Logic Circuit:**
[Click here for a diagram of a 4-to-1 MUX logic circuit](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=4-to-1+mux+logic+circuit)
**What to look for:** Four 3-input AND gates (one for each data input and its select code), one 4-input OR gate, and two inverters for the select lines.

The same principle extends to 8-to-1 MUX (3 select lines) and 16-to-1 MUX (4 select lines).

## 3. Implementing Boolean Functions with Multiplexers

Multiplexers are powerful tools for implementing combinational logic functions. An n-variable function can be implemented using a 2ⁿ-to-1 MUX, or more efficiently, using a 2ⁿ⁻¹-to-1 MUX.

### Method 1: Using a 2ⁿ-to-1 MUX (Full Size)
This is the most straightforward method. For an n-variable function, use a MUX with n select lines.
1.  Connect the `n` variables of the function to the `n` select lines of the MUX.
2.  Examine the truth table of the function. For each combination of the select lines, the output Y should match the function's output.
3.  Connect the data input lines (I₀, I₁, etc.) to either Logic 1 (Vcc) or Logic 0 (GND) based on the corresponding minterm value in the function's truth table. If the function output is 1 for a given minterm, connect that data line to HIGH. If it's 0, connect it to LOW.

**Example:** Implement `F(A,B) = Σm(1,2)` using a 4-to-1 MUX.
*   n = 2 variables (A, B). We need a 2²-to-1 = 4-to-1 MUX.
*   Connect A and B to select lines S₁ and S₀.
*   Truth table for F: m₀=0, m₁=1, m₂=1, m₃=0.
*   Connect data inputs: I₀ -> LOW, I₁ -> HIGH, I₂ -> HIGH, I₃ -> LOW.

### Method 2: Using a 2ⁿ⁻¹-to-1 MUX (Reduced Size)
This is a more efficient and common method. For an n-variable function, use a MUX with `n-1` select lines.
1.  Connect the first `n-1` variables (e.g., A, B for a 3-variable function F(A,B,C)) to the `n-1` select lines.
2.  The last variable (e.g., C) will be used to determine the inputs to the MUX.
3.  Create an **Implementation Table**. List the minterms in pairs. For each pair, observe the relationship between the function's output (F) and the last variable (C). There are four possibilities:
    *   If F is always 0, the data input is `0`.
    *   If F is always 1, the data input is `1`.
    *   If F follows C (F=C), the data input is `C`.
    *   If F is the inverse of C (F=C'), the data input is `
