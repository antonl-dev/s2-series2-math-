# 3.5 Architecture of Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs)

## 1. Introduction to the ALU

The **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** is a fundamental building block of a computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU). It is a digital combinational circuit that performs arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction) and bitwise logic operations (like AND, OR, NOT, XOR) on integer binary numbers.

Essentially, the ALU is the core computational engine of a processor. It takes data from registers, performs an operation, and stores the result back in a register.

**What to look for:** A 'V'-shaped block, which is the standard IEEE symbol for an ALU. It will have inputs for two operands (A and B), a function select input, a result output (Y), and status flags.

## 2. High-Level Block Diagram of an ALU

The architecture of an ALU is best understood through its high-level block diagram. It shows the main functional units and the flow of data and control signals.

**What to look for:** A diagram showing two main sections: an **Arithmetic Unit** and a **Logic Unit**. There are two multi-bit data inputs (Operands A and B), a multi-bit output (Result Y), and a set of control inputs (Function Select). A multiplexer is often shown selecting the final output.

### Key Components:

1.  **Data Inputs (Operands):**
    *   These are the two `n`-bit binary numbers on which the operations are to be performed. They are typically labeled **A** and **B**.
    *   These values are usually loaded into the ALU from input registers.

2.  **Function Select (Opcode):**
    *   These are the control lines (e.g., S₂, S₁, S₀) that tell the ALU which operation to perform.
    *   The binary code applied to these lines is called an **opcode** (operation code). For `m` select lines, the ALU can be designed to perform up to 2ᵐ different operations.

3.  **Result Output (Y):**
    *   This is the `n`-bit result of the operation performed on the operands A and B.
    *   The result is typically stored in an output register, often called the accumulator.

4.  **Status Flags (or Condition Codes):**
    *   These are single-bit outputs that provide information about the result of the latest operation. They are stored in a special **status register** or **flag register**. Common flags include:
        *   **Zero Flag (Z):** Set to 1 if the result of the operation is zero.
        *   **Carry Flag (C):** Set to 1 if an arithmetic operation resulted in a carry-out from the most significant bit (MSB). This indicates an unsigned overflow.
        *   **Sign Flag (S or N):** Set to 1 if the MSB of the result is 1 (indicating a negative number in 2's complement representation).
        *   **Overflow Flag (V):** Set to 1 if a signed arithmetic operation (like 2's complement addition) results in an overflow, meaning the result is too large to fit in the given number of bits.

## 3. Functional Units within the ALU

As the name suggests, the ALU is internally composed of two primary sections:

### 3.1 Arithmetic Unit
This unit is responsible for all arithmetic calculations. The core component is typically a **parallel binary adder**, such as a carry-lookahead adder, which can perform addition. Other arithmetic operations are derived from addition:
*   **Subtraction:** Implemented as addition using the 2's complement of the subtrahend. (A - B is performed as A + B' + 1).
*   **Increment:** Implemented by adding 1 to the operand (A + 1).
*   **Decrement:** Implemented by adding -1 (the 2's complement of 1) to the operand.
*   **Transfer:** Simply passing an operand through without modification (e.g., Y = A).

### 3.2 Logic Unit
This unit performs bitwise logical operations. Unlike arithmetic operations, there is no carry between bit positions. Each bit of the output is determined solely by the corresponding bits of the inputs.
Common logic operations include:
*   **AND:** `Y = A AND B`
*   **OR:** `Y = A OR B`
*   **XOR:** `Y = A ⊕ B`
*   **NOT (Complement):** `Y = A'`

## 4. Simplified Functional Design

The overall operation can be visualized as follows:
1.  Operands A and B are fed simultaneously to **both** the Arithmetic Unit and the Logic Unit.
2.  Both units perform all their possible operations in parallel. For example, the arithmetic unit might calculate A+B, A-B, etc., at the same time the logic unit calculates A AND B, A OR B, etc.
3.  The **Function Select** lines are used as the select inputs to a large **multiplexer (MUX)**.
4.  This MUX selects only one of the many results generated by the functional units and passes it to the final output Y.

This parallel design, combined with a final selection stage, makes the ALU fast and efficient.
