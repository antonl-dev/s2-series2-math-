# 3.4.demux Demultiplexers (DEMUX)

## 1. Introduction to Demultiplexers

A **Demultiplexer**, often abbreviated as **DEMUX**, is a combinational logic circuit that performs the reverse operation of a multiplexer. It is also known as a **"Data Distributor"**. A demultiplexer takes a single data input line and distributes it to one of several possible output lines. A set of "select" lines is used to determine which output line the data is routed to.

A demultiplexer with `n` select lines can route the data input to one of 2ⁿ output lines. This is why a DEMUX is often described as a "one-to-many" device.

**Relationship with Decoders:** A DEMUX is functionally very similar to a decoder. A decoder with an enable input can be used as a demultiplexer. The decoder's inputs (A₀, A₁, etc.) serve as the select lines, and the decoder's enable input (E) serves as the single data input line. When the enable/data line is HIGH, the selected output goes HIGH. When it's LOW, all outputs are LOW.

**What to look for:** A block diagram with a single data input (D or I), `n` select lines (S₀, S₁, ...), and 2ⁿ output lines (Y₀, Y₁, ...).

## 2. Types of Demultiplexers

### 2.1 1-to-2 DEMUX
This is the simplest form of a DEMUX. It has 1 data input line (D), 1 select line (S), and 2 output lines (Y₁, Y₀).

*   **Function:**
    *   If S = 0, the data input D is routed to output Y₀ (`Y₀ = D`), and Y₁ is 0.
    *   If S = 1, the data input D is routed to output Y₁ (`Y₁ = D`), and Y₀ is 0.

*   **Truth Table:**
| S | D | Y₁ | Y₀ |
|---|---|----|----|
| 0 | 0 | 0  | 0  |
| 0 | 1 | 0  | 1  |
| 1 | 0 | 0  | 0  |
| 1 | 1 | 1  | 0  |

*   **Boolean Expressions:**
    *   `Y₀ = D · S'`
    *   `Y₁ = D · S`

*   **Logic Circuit:**
[Click here for a diagram of a 1-to-2 DEMUX logic circuit](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=1-to-2+demux+logic+circuit)
**What to look for:** Two 2-input AND gates and one NOT gate. The data input D is fed to both AND gates. The select line S is connected directly to one AND gate (for Y₁) and through the NOT gate to the other (for Y₀).

### 2.2 1-to-4 DEMUX
A 1-to-4 DEMUX has 1 data input line (D), 2 select lines (S₁, S₀), and 4 output lines (Y₃ to Y₀).

*   **Function:** The 2-bit binary value of the select lines (S₁S₀) determines which output line receives the data D. All other outputs remain at 0.
    *   If S₁S₀ = 00, Y₀ = D.
    *   If S₁S₀ = 01, Y₁ = D.
    *   If S₁S₀ = 10, Y₂ = D.
    *   If S₁S₀ = 11, Y₃ = D.

*   **Truth Table:**
| S₁ | S₀ | D | Y₃ | Y₂ | Y₁ | Y₀ |
|----|----|---|----|----|----|----|
| 0  | 0  | 1 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  |
| 0  | 1  | 1 | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
| 1  | 0  | 1 | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| 1  | 1  | 1 | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
*(Note: If D=0, all outputs are always 0)*

*   **Boolean Expressions:**
    *   `Y₀ = D · S₁' · S₀'`
    *   `Y₁ = D · S₁' · S₀`
    *   `Y₂ = D · S₁ · S₀'`
    *   `Y₃ = D · S₁ · S₀`

*   **Logic Circuit:**
[Click here for a diagram of a 1-to-4 DEMUX logic circuit](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=1-to-4+demux+logic+circuit)
**What to look for:** This circuit is identical to a 2-to-4 decoder where the Data input (D) acts as the Enable line. It consists of four 3-input AND gates and two inverters for the select lines.

The same principle extends to a 1-to-8 DEMUX (3 select lines) and a 1-to-16 DEMUX (4 select lines).

## 3. Applications of Demultiplexers

The primary application of a demultiplexer is to act as a **data distributor**, sending a single stream of data to different destinations.

*   **Serial-to-Parallel Conversion:** A stream of serial data can be fed into the data input of a DEMUX. A synchronized counter connected to the select lines can then be used to cycle through the outputs, placing each bit of the serial data onto a separate parallel line.
*   **Communication Systems:** In a time-division multiplexing (TDM) system, a DEMUX at the receiving end can separate a composite signal back into its original, independent data streams and send each to the correct recipient.
*   **ALU Output Routing:** The output of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) can be routed to one of several different registers using a DEMUX.

### Example: Implementing a Full Adder using a DEMUX
While less common than using a MUX, a DEMUX can be used to implement logic functions. We can use a 1-to-8 DEMUX to create a full adder.
1.  **Inputs & Select Lines:** Use the three inputs of the full adder (A, B, Cin) as the three select lines of the 1-to-8 DEMUX.
2.  **Data Input:** Tie the data input of the DEMUX to a constant HIGH (logic 1). This effectively turns the DEMUX into a 3-to-8 decoder that generates all the minterms.
3.  **Outputs (Sum & Carry):**
    *   The **Sum** for a full adder is `Σm(1, 2, 4, 7)`. Combine the outputs Y₁, Y₂, Y₄, and Y₇ of the DEMUX using an OR gate to produce the Sum.
    *   The **Carry** for a full adder is `Σm(3, 5, 6, 7)`. Combine the outputs Y₃, Y₅, Y₆, and Y₇ using another OR gate to produce the Carry.

**What to look for:** A 1-to-8 DEMUX block. The inputs A, B, Cin are connected to the select lines. The data input is tied to Vcc. Two OR gates are used to combine the appropriate minterm outputs for Sum and Carry.
