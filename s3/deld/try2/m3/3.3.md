# 3.3 Code Converters

## 1. Introduction to Code Converters

A **code converter** is a combinational logic circuit designed to convert a binary code from one format to another. Digital systems use various codes for different purposes, such as BCD for numeric displays, Gray code for error minimization in sequential systems, and ASCII for character representation. Code converters act as translators between these formats.

The design process for a code converter typically involves:
1.  Creating a truth table that maps the inputs of the source code to the desired outputs of the destination code.
2.  Using Karnaugh maps (K-maps) or other simplification methods to derive the simplified Boolean expression for each output bit.
3.  Implementing these expressions using logic gates.

## 2. Binary to Gray Code Converter

### 2.1 Gray Code

**Gray code** is an unweighted binary code where consecutive numbers differ by only a single bit. This property is highly valuable in systems where a changing binary number might be read while it's in transition, as it prevents large erroneous values. For example, transitioning from 7 (0111) to 8 (1000) in standard binary involves four bits changing simultaneously. In Gray code, the transition would only involve one bit change.

### 2.2 4-Bit Binary to Gray Code Converter Design

Let the 4-bit Binary input be B₃B₂B₁B₀ and the 4-bit Gray code output be G₃G₂G₁G₀.

**Conversion Rules (Shortcut Method):**
1.  The Most Significant Bit (MSB) of the Gray code is the same as the MSB of the binary code.
    *   `G₃ = B₃`
2.  Moving from left to right, each subsequent Gray code bit is the XOR of the corresponding binary bit and the binary bit to its left.
    *   `G₂ = B₃ ⊕ B₂`
    *   `G₁ = B₂ ⊕ B₁`
    *   `G₀ = B₁ ⊕ B₀`

**Truth Table:**

| Binary Input (B₃B₂B₁B₀) | Gray Code Output (G₃G₂G₁G₀) |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| 0000                    | 0000                         |
| 0001                    | 0001                         |
| 0010                    | 0011                         |
| 0011                    | 0010                         |
| 0100                    | 0110                         |
| 0101                    | 0111                         |
| 0110                    | 0101                         |
| 0111                    | 0100                         |
| 1000                    | 1100                         |
| 1001                    | 1101                         |
| 1010                    | 1111                         |
| 1011                    | 1110                         |
| 1100                    | 1010                         |
| 1101                    | 1011                         |
| 1110                    | 1001                         |
| 1111                    | 1000                         |

**Logic Derivation and Circuit:**
The logic expressions derived from the rules above are already in their simplest form. The circuit can be implemented directly using XOR gates.

**What to look for:** A circuit with four binary inputs (B₃-B₀). The G₃ output is connected directly to B₃. There are three XOR gates. The first computes `G₂ = B₃ ⊕ B₂`, the second computes `G₁ = B₂ ⊕ B₁`, and the third computes `G₀ = B₁ ⊕ B₀`.

## 3. Gray to Binary Code Converter

### 3.1 4-Bit Gray to Binary Code Converter Design

This circuit performs the reverse operation. Let the 4-bit Gray code input be G₃G₂G₁G₀ and the 4-bit Binary output be B₃B₂B₁B₀.

**Conversion Rules (Shortcut Method):**
1.  The MSB of the Binary code is the same as the MSB of the Gray code.
    *   `B₃ = G₃`
2.  Moving from left to right, each subsequent Binary bit is the XOR of the corresponding Gray code bit and the *previously calculated* Binary bit to its left.
    *   `B₂ = G₂ ⊕ B₃`
    *   `B₁ = G₁ ⊕ B₂`
    *   `B₀ = G₀ ⊕ B₁`

**Boolean Expressions (in terms of Gray inputs only):**
By substituting the expressions into each other, we can define the outputs purely based on the Gray code inputs:
*   `B₃ = G₃`
*   `B₂ = G₂ ⊕ G₃`
*   `B₁ = G₁ ⊕ B₂ = G₁ ⊕ (G₂ ⊕ G₃) = G₁ ⊕ G₂ ⊕ G₃`
*   `B₀ = G₀ ⊕ B₁ = G₀ ⊕ (G₁ ⊕ G₂ ⊕ G₃) = G₀ ⊕ G₁ ⊕ G₂ ⊕ G₃`

**Truth Table:** The truth table would be the reverse of the one shown for the Binary-to-Gray converter.

**Logic Circuit:**

[Click here for a diagram of a 4-bit Gray to Binary code converter circuit](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=4-bit+gray+to+binary+code+converter+logic+circuit)
**What to look for:** A circuit with four Gray code inputs (G₃-G₀). The B₃ output is connected directly to G₃. There are three XOR gates in a cascaded/feedback arrangement. The output of the first XOR gate (B₃) is fed into the second, and so on.

## 4. Other Code Converters

The same design principles can be applied to create any other type of code converter. For example:
*   **BCD to Excess-3 Converter:** A 4-bit BCD input is converted to a 4-bit Excess-3 output. The logic is derived from a truth table, and since Excess-3 code is the BCD code plus 3 (0011), this can also be implemented using a 4-bit binary adder.
*   **BCD to Gray Code Converter:** A truth table would be created mapping the 10 valid BCD inputs to their corresponding Gray code equivalents. K-maps would then be used to find the simplest logic for each of the 4 output bits.
