### Section 1: Comparators and Parity Circuits

1.  **Design** a 2-bit magnitude comparator circuit that takes two 2-bit numbers, A (A₁A₀) and B (B₁B₀), as input and produces three outputs: G (A>B), E (A=B), and L (A<B). Provide the simplified Boolean expressions for G, E, and L.
2.  Explain the difference between a parity generator and a parity checker.
3.  **Design** a 4-bit **even** parity generator. The inputs are D₃, D₂, D₁, D₀. Provide the Boolean expression and draw the logic circuit using XOR gates.
4.  A 4-bit data word `1011` is transmitted using an **odd** parity system. What is the value of the transmitted parity bit? The receiver gets the 5-bit message `10111`. Does the parity checker at the receiver detect an error? Explain why or why not.
5.  What is the primary limitation of using a single parity bit for error detection?

### Section 2: Encoders and Decoders

6.  **Differentiate** between an encoder and a decoder. Mention at least three distinct differences.
7.  What is the main advantage of a **priority encoder** over a simple encoder? Provide an example of an input condition where this advantage is critical.
8.  **Implement** the Boolean function `F(A,B,C) = Σm(0, 2, 3, 7)` using a 3-to-8 decoder and a single OR gate. Draw the circuit diagram.
9.  How can a 4-to-16 decoder be constructed using two 3-to-8 decoders with enable inputs? Draw a block diagram and explain the connections, especially for the most significant input bit.
10. Explain the functional difference between a **Common Anode** and a **Common Cathode** seven-segment display. For a common anode display, what logic level (HIGH or LOW) is required to turn a segment ON?
11. A BCD to 7-segment decoder receives the invalid BCD input `1100` (decimal 12). Why is this input considered invalid, and how is it typically handled during the K-map simplification process for the decoder's logic?

### Section 3: Code Converters

12. Draw the logic diagram for a 4-bit **Binary-to-Gray** code converter.
13. Draw the logic diagram for a 4-bit **Gray-to-Binary** code converter.

### Section 4: Multiplexers and Demultiplexers

16. **Implement** the following 4-variable Boolean function using an **8-to-1 Multiplexer**:
    `F(A,B,C,D) = Σm(0, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15)`
    Show the implementation table and the final connections to the MUX data inputs (I₀ to I₇).
17. How can a 2-to-4 decoder with an enable input be used as a 1-to-4 demultiplexer? Describe the connections.
18. Draw the logic circuit for a 1-to-4 demultiplexer.
19. Show how to implement a **Full Adder** circuit using a 3-to-8 decoder (or a 1-to-8 demultiplexer with data input tied to HIGH) and two OR gates. Provide the Boolean expressions for Sum and Carry in minterm format.

### Section 5: ALU Architecture

20. Draw a high-level block schematic diagram of an `n`-bit ALU. Clearly label the operand inputs, the result output, the function select lines, and the status flags output.
21. What is the role of the status flags (e.g., Zero, Carry, Sign) in an ALU? Provide a brief description of each.
22. Explain how the arithmetic unit of an ALU can perform the operation `A - B` using a binary adder and 2's complement logic.
