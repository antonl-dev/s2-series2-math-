# Module 1: Number Systems and Logic Gate Fundamentals

## 1.1 Introduction to Number Systems and Conversions

### 1. Introduction

A **number system** is a systematic way to represent numbers using a set of symbols or digits. The **base** or **radix** of a number system is the total number of unique digits used to represent numbers in that system. In digital electronics, we primarily deal with four number systems.

| Number System | Base (Radix) | Digits Used                                  |
| :-------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Decimal         | 10             | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9                 |
| Binary          | 2              | 0, 1                                         |
| Octal           | 8              | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7                       |
| Hexadecimal     | 16             | 0-9, A(10), B(11), C(12), D(13), E(14), F(15) |

### 2. Conversions from Other Bases to Decimal

The fundamental method to convert any number from its base to the decimal system is to use its **positional weight**. Multiply each digit by its base raised to the power of its position, and then sum all the products.

The position is 0 for the rightmost digit of the integer part, increasing to the left, and -1 for the first digit of the fractional part, decreasing to the right.

#### a. Binary to Decimal

**Method:** Multiply each binary digit by its positional weight (powers of 2) and sum the results.

**Example (from question paper):** Convert `(1100.101)₂` to decimal.
```
  1       1       0       0   .   1       0       1
  |       |       |       |       |       |       |
 2³      2²      2¹      2⁰      2⁻¹     2⁻²     2⁻³
  |       |       |       |       |       |       |
  8       4       2       1      0.5    0.25    0.125

= (1 × 2³) + (1 × 2²) + (0 × 2¹) + (0 × 2⁰) + (1 × 2⁻¹) + (0 × 2⁻²) + (1 × 2⁻³)
= 8 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0.5 + 0 + 0.125
= 12.625₁₀
```

#### b. Octal to Decimal

**Method:** Multiply each octal digit by its positional weight (powers of 8) and sum the results.

**Example (from notes):** Convert `(621)₈` to decimal.
```
= (6 × 8²) + (2 × 8¹) + (1 × 8⁰)
= (6 × 64) + (2 × 8) + (1 × 1)
= 384 + 16 + 1
= 401₁₀
```

#### c. Hexadecimal to Decimal

**Method:** Multiply each hexadecimal digit by its positional weight (powers of 16) and sum the results. Remember to convert letters (A-F) to their decimal equivalents (10-15).

**Example (from notes):** Convert `(CAD)₁₆` to decimal.
```
C = 12, A = 10, D = 13

= (12 × 16²) + (10 × 16¹) + (13 × 16⁰)
= (12 × 256) + (10 × 16) + (13 × 1)
= 3072 + 160 + 13
= 3245₁₀
```

### 3. Conversions from Decimal to Other Bases

#### a. Decimal to Binary

**Method:**
*   **For the integer part:** Use the method of repeated division by 2. The remainders, read from bottom to top, form the binary number.
*   **For the fractional part:** Use the method of repeated multiplication by 2. The integer part of the product (0 or 1) forms the binary fraction, read from top to bottom.

**Example (from question paper):** Convert `(7.75)₁₀` to binary.

**Integer Part (7):**
```
2 | 7 | 1  (LSB - Least Significant Bit)
  ---
2 | 3 | 1
  ---
2 | 1 | 1  (MSB - Most Significant Bit)
  ---
    0
```
Reading upwards: `111₂`

**Fractional Part (0.75):**
```
0.75 × 2 = 1.50  -> Integer part is 1
0.50 × 2 = 1.00  -> Integer part is 1
```
Reading downwards: `.11₂`

**Result:** `(7.75)₁₀ = (111.11)₂`

#### b. Decimal to Octal

**Method:** Use repeated division by 8 for the integer part and repeated multiplication by 8 for the fractional part.

**Example (from notes):** Convert `(112)₁₀` to octal.
```
8 | 112 | 0  (LSB)
  -----
8 |  14 | 6
  -----
    1   | 1  (MSB)
```
Reading upwards: `160₈`

#### c. Decimal to Hexadecimal

**Method:** Use repeated division by 16 for the integer part. Convert remainders greater than 9 to their hex equivalents (A-F).

**Example (from notes):** Convert `(254)₁₀` to hexadecimal.
```
16 | 254 | 14 (E)  (LSB)
   -----
     15  | 15 (F)  (MSB)
```
Reading upwards: `FE₁₆`

### 4. Conversions Between Binary, Octal & Hexadecimal

These conversions use binary as a common bridge and rely on grouping bits.

#### a. Binary to Octal & Vice Versa

**Relationship:** `2³ = 8`. This means one octal digit represents exactly 3 binary digits.

*   **Binary to Octal:** Group binary digits into sets of 3, starting from the binary point. Add leading/trailing zeros if needed. Convert each group to its octal equivalent.
    *   **Example:** Convert `(10110110.11)₂` to octal.
        ```
        Grouped: (010)(110)(110).(110)
        Octal:      2    6    6   .   6
        Result: 266.6₈
        ```
*   **Octal to Binary:** Convert each octal digit to its 3-bit binary equivalent.
    *   **Example:** Convert `(25.3)₈` to binary.
        ```
        Octal:    2   5   .   3
        Binary: 010 101 . 011
        Result: (010101.011)₂
        ```

#### b. Binary to Hexadecimal & Vice Versa

**Relationship:** `2⁴ = 16`. This means one hexadecimal digit represents exactly 4 binary digits.

*   **Binary to Hexadecimal:** Group binary digits into sets of 4, starting from the binary point. Convert each group.
    *   **Example (from question paper):** Convert `(10110010)₂` to hex.
        ```
        Grouped: (1011)(0010)
        Hex:        B     2
        Result: B2₁₆
        ```
*   **Hexadecimal to Binary:** Convert each hex digit to its 4-bit binary equivalent.
    *   **Example:** Convert `(3A8)₁₆` to binary.
        ```
        Hex:       3      A      8
        Binary:  0011   1010   1000
        Result: (001110101000)₂
        ```

#### c. Octal to Hexadecimal & Vice Versa

**Method:** Use binary as an intermediate step. There is no direct conversion method.
1.  Convert the original number (Octal/Hex) to Binary.
2.  Regroup the binary bits according to the target base (3 for Octal, 4 for Hex).
3.  Convert the grouped bits to the final number system.

**Example (from notes):** Convert `(25.3)₈` to hexadecimal.
1.  **Octal to Binary:** `(25.3)₈ = (010101.011)₂`
2.  **Regroup for Hex (4 bits):** `(0001)(0101).(0110)`
3.  **Binary to Hex:** `(1)(5).(6)`
4.  **Result:** `(15.6)₁₆`
