# Module 1: Number Systems and Logic Gate Fundamentals

## 1.2 Digital Codes

In addition to number systems, digital electronics uses various **codes** to represent data. While a number system is a way of representing quantities, a code is a set of rules for representing information (which could be numbers, letters, or symbols).

### 1. Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)

BCD is a way to represent decimal digits (0-9) using a 4-bit binary code. It is a **weighted code**, where the weights are 8, 4, 2, and 1. It differs from pure binary representation.

*   **Conversion (Decimal to BCD):** Each decimal digit is individually converted to its 4-bit binary equivalent.
*   **Invalid Codes:** The 4-bit binary combinations for 10-15 (`1010` through `1111`) are invalid in BCD.

**Example:** Convert `(47)₁₀` to BCD.
` (47)₁₀ = (0100 0111)BCD `

#### BCD Addition

**Rules for BCD Addition:**
1.  Add the two BCD numbers using binary addition.
2.  If the 4-bit sum is **greater than 9 (`1001`)** OR if a **carry is generated**, the result is invalid.
3.  **Correction:** To correct an invalid result, **add 6 (`0110`)** to that 4-bit group.

> **What to look for:** Look for a diagram that shows two BCD numbers being added. It should have decision boxes asking "Is result > 9?" and "Was there a carry?". Based on the answers, it should show the path to either do nothing or "Add 6".

### 2. Excess-3 (XS-3) Code

This is a **non-weighted** code derived from BCD by adding 3 (`0011`) to each BCD code. Its key property is being **self-complementing**, which simplifies subtraction circuits.

**Example (from answer key):** Convert `(156.3)₁₀` to XS-3.
```
Decimal:   1      5      6   .   3
   +3:    +3     +3     +3       +3
        ----   ----   ----     ----
           4      8      9   .    6
   
XS-3:   0100   1000   1001 .  0110
```

### 3. Gray Code

Gray code is a **non-weighted** code where successive code words differ by only a single bit. This **unit-distance property** is crucial for preventing errors in electromechanical systems like shaft encoders.

> **Visual Aid:** Comparing a binary vs. a Gray code encoder shows the benefit.

>
> **What to look for:** Look for two circular discs, one with a binary pattern and one with a Gray code pattern. Notice the transition from 3 to 4 on the binary disc (two bits `011` -> `100` change), while on the Gray code disc, only one bit changes. This prevents false readings during the transition.

#### a. Binary to Gray Conversion
The MSB is the same. Then, XOR adjacent binary bits. `G(i) = B(i) ⊕ B(i+1)`.

#### b. Gray to Binary Conversion
The MSB is the same. Then, XOR the current Gray bit with the *previous binary bit*. `B(i) = G(i) ⊕ B(i+1)`.

### 4. Error Detection Codes - Parity

A **parity bit** is an extra bit added to a binary word to detect an odd number of bit errors.
*   **Even Parity:** Total number of 1s (including parity) is even.
*   **Odd Parity:** Total number of 1s is odd.

> **Visual Aid:** A block diagram shows the parity generation and checking process.

> **What to look for:** A diagram showing a "Parity Generator" taking data bits and producing a parity bit. These are sent through a "Transmission Channel" (where an error might occur) to a "Parity Checker" which verifies if the received data matches the received parity bit.

### 5. ASCII Code
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a 7-bit code used to represent alphanumeric characters. An 8th bit is often added for parity.
