## 1.5 TTL and CMOS Logic Families

### 1. Introduction to Logic Families

A **logic family** is a collection of different integrated circuit (IC) chips that share the same underlying circuit technology and have standardized logical levels and power supply characteristics. Gates from the same family can be easily interconnected without special interfacing.

The two most dominant and historically significant logic families are:
1.  **TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic):** Based on Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs).
2.  **CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor):** Based on Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs).

To understand and compare these families, we use several key performance parameters.

### 2. Key Characteristics of Logic Families

*   **Voltage Levels:**
    *   **V<sub>IH</sub> (Input High Voltage):** The *minimum* voltage level at an input that is guaranteed to be recognized as a logic '1'.
    *   **V<sub>IL</sub> (Input Low Voltage):** The *maximum* voltage level at an input that is guaranteed to be recognized as a logic '0'.
    *   **V<sub>OH</sub> (Output High Voltage):** The *minimum* voltage level at an output when it is driving a logic '1'.
    *   **V<sub>OL</sub> (Output Low Voltage):** The *maximum* voltage level at an output when it is driving a logic '0'.
*   **Noise Margin:** A measure of a circuit's ability to tolerate noise. A larger noise margin is better.
    *   **High-State Noise Margin (N<sub>MH</sub>):** N<sub>MH</sub> = V<sub>OH</sub> - V<sub>IH</sub>
    *   **Low-State Noise Margin (N<sub>ML</sub>):** N<sub>ML</sub> = V<sub>IL</sub> - V<sub>OL</sub>

    >
    > **What to look for:** Look for a graph that shows two voltage scales, one for the input and one for the output. It should label V<sub>IH</sub>, V<sub>IL</sub>, V<sub>OH</sub>, and V<sub>OL</sub>, and clearly show the high and low noise margins (N<sub>MH</sub> and N<sub>ML</sub>) as the buffer zones between the valid output and input levels.

*   **Propagation Delay (t<sub>pd</sub>):** The time it takes for the output of a gate to change in response to a change in its input. A lower propagation delay means a faster gate.
*   **Power Dissipation:** The amount of power (in milliwatts, mW) that a logic gate consumes. Lower power dissipation is desirable, especially for battery-powered devices.
*   **Fan-Out:** The maximum number of standard inputs from the same logic family that a single output can reliably drive without degrading its performance.

### 3. TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) Family

The TTL family was the workhorse of digital electronics for many years. It uses BJTs as its switching elements. The standard power supply voltage (V<sub>CC</sub>) is **5V**.

*   **Operation:** TTL gates work by driving transistors into either saturation (ON) or cutoff (OFF) states. A key feature is the **multi-emitter transistor** often used at the input stage.

    >
    > **What to look for:** Look for a circuit symbol of a BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor) that has one base, one collector, but multiple arrows for the emitter. This visually represents the unique input stage of a TTL gate.

*   **Standard 74-series TTL Characteristics:**
    *   **V<sub>IH</sub>:** 2.0 V
    *   **V<sub>IL</sub>:** 0.8 V
    *   **V<sub>OH</sub>:** 2.4 V
    *   **V<sub>OL</sub>:** 0.4 V
    *   **Noise Margin:** N<sub>MH</sub> = 0.4V. N<sub>ML</sub> = 0.4V. (This is relatively low, making it susceptible to noise).
    *   **Propagation Delay:** ~10 ns (nanoseconds).
    *   **Power Dissipation:** ~10 mW per gate.
    *   **Fan-Out:** Typically 10.

*   **TTL Sub-families:** To improve performance, several sub-families were developed, such as 74L (Low Power), 74H (High Speed), 74S (Schottky), and the very popular **74LS (Low-Power Schottky)**.

### 4. CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) Family

The CMOS family has now largely replaced TTL in most applications due to its superior power characteristics. It uses a complementary pair of **PMOS** (P-channel) and **NMOS** (N-channel) MOSFETs.

*   **Operation:** In a CMOS gate, for any given input, one transistor is ON while the other is OFF. This creates a direct path from the output to either V<sub>DD</sub> (power) or GND (ground), but never both simultaneously in a static state. This is best visualized with a simple CMOS inverter.
    > **Visual Aid:** The CMOS inverter is the fundamental building block.
    >
    > [Click here to see a CMOS inverter diagram](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=CMOS+inverter+circuit+diagram)
    >
    > **What to look for:** Look for a circuit with two transistors. The top one should be a PMOS transistor (often shown with a circle at the gate) connected to VDD, and the bottom one should be an NMOS transistor connected to Ground (GND). Their gates are tied together as the input (Vin), and their drains are tied together as the output (Vout).

*   **Key Advantage: Low Power Consumption.** Because one transistor is always OFF in a steady state, there is almost no static current flow from V<sub>DD</sub> to GND. Power is primarily consumed only during the switching of states.
*   **5V CMOS (74HC series) Characteristics:**
    *   **V<sub>IH</sub>:** 3.5 V
    *   **V<sub>IL</sub>:** 1.5 V
    *   **V<sub>OH</sub>:** ~4.9 V (close to V<sub>DD</sub>)
    *   **V<sub>OL</sub>:** ~0.1 V (close to GND)
    *   **Noise Margin:** Excellent (~1.4V).
    *   **Propagation Delay:** Varies, but comparable to 74LS series (~10 ns).
    *   **Power Dissipation:** Very low static power (~microwatts), but increases with switching frequency.
    *   **Fan-Out:** Very high (typically >50).
