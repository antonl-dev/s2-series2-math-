# MODULE I: Topic 1.2a - BCD Arithmetic (Addition)

**Objective:** To master the procedure for adding two BCD numbers, including handling the necessary corrections for invalid results.

---

### **Why BCD Addition is Special**

You cannot simply add two BCD numbers using standard binary addition and expect the correct BCD result.

*   **Consider `5 + 8`:**
    *   In BCD: `0101` (5) + `1000` (8)
    *   Binary Sum: `1101`
    *   The problem: `1101` is **13** in binary, but it is an **invalid BCD code**. The correct BCD answer should be for `13`, which is `0001 0011`.

To solve this, we need a correction rule.

### **The Rules for BCD Addition**

Perform binary addition on the 4-bit BCD groups. After adding, check the 4-bit result for two conditions:

1.  **Condition 1: Is the 4-bit sum greater than 9 (`1001`)?**
2.  **Condition 2: Was a carry generated out of the 4-bit group?**

**If EITHER of these conditions is TRUE for any 4-bit group, then that group's result is invalid.**

**The Correction Step:** If a 4-bit sum is invalid, you must **ADD 6** (binary `0110`) to that 4-bit sum. The carry generated from this addition is then passed to the next 4-bit group.

*   **Why add 6?** There are 16 possible 4-bit values (`0-15`), but only 10 are valid for BCD (`0-9`). The difference is `16 - 10 = 6`. Adding 6 "skips over" the 6 invalid BCD codes.

### **Worked Example 1: `48 + 49`**

1.  **Represent in BCD:**
    *   48 → `0100 1000`
    *   49 → `0100 1001`

2.  **Perform Binary Addition:**
    ```
        0100  1000   (48)
      + 0100  1001   (49)
      -----------
        1001  0001
    ```

3.  **Check and Correct Each Group:**
    *   **Right Group (LSB): `0001`**
        *   Is it > 9? No.
        *   Was a carry generated? No.
        *   Result is **VALID**. No correction needed.
    *   **Left Group (MSB): `1001`**
        *   Is it > 9? No. (It is exactly 9).
        *   Was a carry generated? No.
        *   Result is **VALID**. No correction needed.

4.  **Final Answer:** `1001 0001`. In decimal, this is `97`. Correct.

### **Worked Example 2: `58 + 25` (Correction Needed)**

1.  **Represent in BCD:**
    *   58 → `0101 1000`
    *   25 → `0010 0101`

2.  **Perform Binary Addition:**
    ```
          1          (carry from right group)
        0101  1000   (58)
      + 0010  0101   (25)
      -----------
        1000  1101
    ```

3.  **Check and Correct Each Group:**
    *   **Right Group (LSB): `1101`**
        *   Is it > 9 (`1001`)? **Yes.**
        *   Result is **INVALID**. We must add 6.
    *   **Left Group (MSB): `1000`** (after adding the carry from the right group's initial sum)
        *   Is it > 9? No.
        *   Was a carry generated? No.
        *   Result is **VALID**.

4.  **Apply Correction to the Invalid Group:**
    ```
        1101   (Invalid sum of right group)
      + 0110   (Add 6)
      -----------
      1 0011   (New sum for right group, with a carry-out)
    ```
    *   The new result for the right group is `0011`.
    *   The `carry-out (1)` from this correction must be added to the next group.

5.  **Re-calculate the Left Group with the new carry:**
    ```
        1000   (Original sum of left group)
      +    1   (Carry from the correction)
      -----------
        1001   (This is wrong. Let's restart the whole addition process step-by-step to be clear)
    ```
    
**Let's do this the clean way:**

```
      (Carry)        1  0  0  0
                     0101   1000   (58)
                   + 0010   0101   (25)
                   -------------
      Initial Sum:     0111   1101

      Check Right Group: 1101 > 9? Yes. Invalid. Add 6.
                     ....   1101
                          + 0110
                          -------
                     .... 1 0011   -> Carry the 1 to the next group

      Check Left Group:  0111 (from initial sum)
                       +    1 (from correction carry)
                       -------
                         1000
      Is 1000 > 9? No. Valid.

      Combine Final Groups:  1000   0011
```
The answer is `1000 0011`. This is BCD for `83`. `58 + 25 = 83`. Correct.
