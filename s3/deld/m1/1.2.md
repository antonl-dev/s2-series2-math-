# MODULE I: Topic 1.2 - Special Digital Codes

**Objective:** To understand, convert, and differentiate between BCD, Gray Code, Excess-3, and Parity Codes.

### **1. BCD (Binary Coded Decimal)**

**Concept:** BCD is not a number system conversion; it's an **encoding**. It's a way to represent decimal numbers (`0-9`) in a binary world, making it easier for human-facing displays (like calculators or digital clocks) to interact with binary logic.

**The Rule:** Represent **each individual decimal digit** with its own **4-bit binary equivalent**.

*   **Example 1: Convert Decimal `49` to BCD.**
    1.  Separate the decimal digits: `4` and `9`.
    2.  Convert each digit to its 4-bit binary form:
        *   `4` → `0100`
        *   `9` → `1001`
    3.  Combine the BCD codes: `0100 1001`.
    *   **Answer: `(0100 1001)BCD`**

*   **Crucial Distinction:** The pure binary representation of `49` is `110001`. As you can see, BCD is different and often uses more bits.

**Valid vs. Invalid BCD:**
Since decimal digits only go from 0 to 9, only the 4-bit binary codes for 0 (`0000`) through 9 (`1001`) are valid. The binary codes `1010` (10) through `1111` (15) are **invalid** in BCD. This becomes important later in BCD arithmetic.

### **2. Gray Code**

**Concept:** A special binary code where any two successive values differ by **only one bit**. Its primary use is in electro-mechanical systems like rotary encoders, where a small misalignment could cause a standard binary counter to jump between wildly different values (e.g., from 3 (`011`) to 4 (`100`), where all three bits change). Gray code prevents this.

**The Rule (Binary to Gray Conversion):**
1.  The Most Significant Bit (MSB) of the Gray code is the same as the MSB of the binary number.
2.  From left to right, **XOR** the current binary bit with the **previous binary bit** to get the next Gray code bit.
    *   Formula: `G(i) = B(i) ⊕ B(i+1)` where `B(i+1)` is the bit to the left of `B(i)`.

*   **Example 2: Convert Binary `1011` to Gray Code.**
    *   Binary: `B₃ B₂ B₁ B₀` = `1 0 1 1`
    1.  **Find G₃:** The MSB is the same.
        *   `G₃ = B₃ = 1`
    2.  **Find G₂:** XOR the current bit (`B₂`) with the previous bit (`B₃`).
        *   `G₂ = B₃ ⊕ B₂ = 1 ⊕ 0 = 1`
    3.  **Find G₁:** XOR `B₁` with `B₂`.
        *   `G₁ = B₂ ⊕ B₁ = 0 ⊕ 1 = 1`
    4.  **Find G₀:** XOR `B₀` with `B₁`.
        *   `G₀ = B₁ ⊕ B₀ = 1 ⊕ 1 = 0`
    5.  Combine the Gray code bits: `G₃ G₂ G₁ G₀`
    *   **Answer: `1110` (Gray)**

### **3. Excess-3 Code**

**Concept:** A "self-complementing" BCD code. This means the 9's complement of a decimal number can be found by simply inverting the bits of its Excess-3 code, which was useful in older arithmetic circuits.

**The Rule:** Add `3` (binary `0011`) to the **BCD code of each decimal digit**.

*   **Example 3: Convert Decimal `49` to Excess-3.**
    1.  Separate the decimal digits: `4` and `9`.
    2.  Find the BCD for each digit:
        *   BCD of `4` = `0100`
        *   BCD of `9` = `1001`
    3.  Add `0011` to each BCD group:
        *   For `4`: `0100 + 0011 = 0111`
        *   For `9`: `1001 + 0011 = 1100`
    4.  Combine the results.
    *   **Answer: `0111 1100` (Excess-3)**

### **4. Parity Code (Error Detection)**

**Concept:** The simplest form of error detection. A single bit (the **parity bit**) is added to a binary word to make the total count of `1`s either even or odd. It can detect a single-bit error but cannot correct it.

**Two Types:**

*   **Even Parity:** The parity bit is set to `0` or `1` to make the **total number of `1`s an even number**.
    *   **Example 4: Generate the even parity bit for the data `10110`**.
        1.  Count the `1`s in the data: There are three `1`s.
        2.  The count is odd. To make the total count even, the parity bit must be `1`.
        3.  The transmitted word becomes `10110`**`1`**. (Now has four `1`s).

*   **Odd Parity:** The parity bit is set to `0` or `1` to make the **total number of `1`s an odd number**.
    *   **Example 5: Generate the odd parity bit for the data `10110`**.
        1.  Count the `1`s in the data: There are three `1`s.
        2.  The count is already odd. To keep the total count odd, the parity bit must be `0`.
        3.  The transmitted word becomes `10110`**`0`**. (Still has three `1`s).

### **YOUR TURN: Topic 1.2 (Practice in Notebook)**

1.  **BCD:** What is the BCD representation for the decimal number `173`?
2.  **Gray Code:** Convert the binary number `1110` to Gray code.
3.  **Excess-3:** Find the Excess-3 code for the decimal number `6`.
4.  **Parity:** A 4-bit data word `1101` is to be transmitted. What is the final 5-bit word if you use **even parity**?
