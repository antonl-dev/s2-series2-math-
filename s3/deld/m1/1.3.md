# MODULE I: Topic 1.3 - Signed Numbers Representation

**Objective:** To master the representation of negative binary numbers and the process of binary subtraction using 1's and 2's complement methods. The 2's complement method is the industry standard and a highly probable exam question.

### **The Problem with "Sign-Magnitude"**

The simplest way to represent a signed number is to use the Most Significant Bit (MSB) as a sign bit (`0` for positive, `1` for negative). This is called **Sign-Magnitude**.

*   `+25` as 8-bit Sign-Magnitude: `00011001`
*   `-25` as 8-bit Sign-Magnitude: `10011001`

**Why it's not used in modern computers:**
1.  **Two Zeros:** It results in a "positive zero" (`00000000`) and a "negative zero" (`10000000`), which complicates logic.
2.  **Difficult Arithmetic:** The hardware required for addition and subtraction is complex because the sign bit must be handled separately from the magnitude.

To solve this, complement methods were developed.

### **1. 1's Complement Representation**

**Concept:** A slightly better way to represent negative numbers.

**The Rule:**
*   **For positive numbers:** The representation is the same as simple binary. MSB is `0`.
*   **For negative numbers:** Invert **all** the bits of the corresponding positive number. MSB becomes `1`.

*   **Example 1: Find the 8-bit 1's complement of -25.**
    1.  Start with the positive binary representation of 25: `00011001`.
    2.  Invert every bit: `11100110`.
    *   **Answer: `11100110`**

**Subtraction using 1's Complement (A - B):**
1.  Find the 1's complement of B.
2.  Add it to A: `A + (1's comp of B)`.
3.  **End-Around Carry Rule:**
    *   **If a final carry is generated:** The result is **POSITIVE**. Add this carry bit back to the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of the result.
    *   **If NO final carry is generated:** The result is **NEGATIVE** and is in 1's complement form. To find its magnitude, take the 1's complement of the result.

*   This method also suffers from the "two zeros" problem (`00000000` and `11111111`), so it's not the final solution.

### **2. 2's Complement Representation (The Standard Method)**

**Concept:** This is the universal method used by all modern processors. It solves all the problems of the previous methods. It has only one representation for zero and makes subtraction as easy as addition for the hardware.

**The Rule:**
*   **For positive numbers:** The representation is the same as simple binary. MSB is `0`.
*   **For negative numbers:** Take the **2's complement** of the corresponding positive number. MSB becomes `1`.
    *   **To find 2's complement:** Invert all bits (1's complement) and then **add 1**.

*   **Example 2: Find the 8-bit 2's complement of -25.**
    1.  Start with positive 25: `00011001`.
    2.  Find 1's complement (invert): `11100110`.
    3.  Add 1: `11100110 + 1 = 11100111`.
    *   **Answer: `11100111`**

### **Subtraction using 2's Complement (Guaranteed Question)**

This procedure is critical.

*   **[Click here to see a visual diagram of the 2's Complement Subtraction process.](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=2%27s+complement+subtraction+flowchart)**

**The Procedure (A - B):**
1.  **Find the 2's complement of B.** (The number being subtracted).
2.  **Add this complement to A.** `A + (2's Comp of B)`
3.  **Interpret the Result based on the Final Carry:**

    *   **Case 1: A final carry is generated.**
        *   This means the result is **POSITIVE**.
        *   **Action: DISCARD THE CARRY.** The remaining bits are the correct answer in normal binary form.

    *   **Case 2: NO final carry is generated.**
        *   This means the result is **NEGATIVE**.
        *   **Action: The result is in 2's complement form.** To find its decimal magnitude, you must take the 2's complement of the result itself.

*   **Example 3 (From your exam paper): Perform `14 - 45` using 8-bit 2's complement.**
    1.  **Represent numbers in 8-bit binary:**
        *   A = +14 = `00001110`
        *   B = +45 = `00101101`
    2.  **Find 2's complement of B (45):**
        *   1's Complement of 45: `11010010`
        *   Add 1: `11010011`  (This is the representation of -45)
    3.  **Add to A (14):**
        ```
          00001110   (14)
        + 11010011   (-45)
        -----------
          11011101
        ```
    4.  **Interpret:**
        *   Was a carry generated from the 8th bit? **No.**
        *   Therefore, the answer is **negative** and is `11011101`.
        *   To find the magnitude, take its 2's complement:
            *   Invert `11011101` → `00100010`
            *   Add 1 → `00100011`
        *   Convert `00100011` to decimal: `32 + 2 + 1 = 35`.
    *   **Final Answer: -35**

1.  **Represent -48 in 8-bit binary using:**
    *   a) Sign-Magnitude
    *   b) 1's Complement
    *   c) 2's Complement

2.  **Solve `50 - 22` using 8-bit 2's complement arithmetic.** You should get a positive answer. Follow the "discard carry" rule and verify your result. Write down every step.
