# MODULE I: Topic 1.6 - Internal Diagram of TTL NAND and CMOS NOR Gate

**Objective:** To be able to draw, from memory, the internal schematic of a 2-input TTL NAND gate and a 2-input CMOS NOR gate, and to identify the key stages/components in each.

### **1. Internal Diagram of a 2-Input TTL NAND Gate**

**Concept:** This specific circuit is a classic example of TTL design. It is typically broken down into three functional stages. Your exam question requires you to draw and explain this.

*   **[Click here to see a clear, labeled diagram for "TTL NAND gate with totem-pole output"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=labeled+TTL+NAND+gate+with+totem-pole+output)**
    *   *Study the diagrams at this link. Choose one that is clearly labeled with Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and the different stages. This will be your reference for memorization.*

**Breakdown of the Circuit Stages:**

1.  **Input Stage (The Logic Stage):**
    *   **Component:** `Q1`, a **multi-emitter BJT**. This is the most unique part of the TTL gate.
    *   **Function:** The two emitters are the inputs `A` and `B`. This transistor performs the logical AND operation. If **both** A and B are `HIGH`, current will not flow through the emitters; instead, it will flow through the collector. If **either** A or B is `LOW`, it will pull the current through the emitter to ground.

2.  **Phase Splitter Stage (Control Stage):**
    *   **Component:** `Q2`, a standard NPN BJT.
    *   **Function:** This transistor acts as a driver for the output stage. It gets its input from the collector of `Q1`. It provides two signals that are out of phase (complements of each other): one from its collector and one from its emitter. This ensures that the two transistors in the output stage are never turned on at the same time.

3.  **Output Stage (The "Totem-Pole" Output):**
    *   **Components:** `Q3` (top transistor), a diode `D1`, and `Q4` (bottom transistor).
    *   **Function:** This push-pull arrangement is responsible for creating a strong `HIGH` or `LOW` output.
        *   When the output should be **HIGH**, `Q3` turns ON and `Q4` turns OFF. `Q3` "sources" current from the +5V supply to the output.
        *   When the output should be **LOW**, `Q4` turns ON and `Q3` turns OFF. `Q4` "sinks" current from the output to ground.
    *   **Overall Logic:** The combination of the AND input stage and the inverting action of the phase splitter results in **NAND** logic.

### **2. Internal Diagram of a 2-Input CMOS NOR Gate**

**Concept:** This circuit perfectly demonstrates the complementary nature of CMOS. It consists of two distinct networks of transistors.

*   **[Click here to see a clear, labeled diagram for "CMOS 2-input NOR gate diagram"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=CMOS+2-input+NOR+gate+diagram)**
    *   *Study the diagrams. Choose one that clearly shows the PMOS and NMOS transistors and the pull-up/pull-down networks.*

**Breakdown of the Circuit Networks:**

1.  **The Pull-Up Network (Creates the HIGH output):**
    *   **Components:** Two **PMOS** transistors connected in **SERIES** between the power supply (`Vdd`) and the output `Y`.
    *   **Function:** PMOS transistors turn ON when their gate voltage is `LOW` (logic 0). For the output `Y` to be pulled `HIGH`, there must be a complete path from `Vdd` to `Y`. This only happens if **both** series PMOS transistors are ON. This requires both input `A` **AND** input `B` to be `LOW`.
    *   *Logic: `Y` is HIGH if `A=0` AND `B=0`.*

2.  **The Pull-Down Network (Creates the LOW output):**
    *   **Components:** Two **NMOS** transistors connected in **PARALLEL** between the output `Y` and Ground (`GND`).
    *   **Function:** NMOS transistors turn ON when their gate voltage is `HIGH` (logic 1). For the output `Y` to be pulled `LOW`, there must be a path to `GND`. This will happen if **either** the top NMOS transistor is ON (i.e., input `A` is `HIGH`) **OR** the bottom NMOS transistor is ON (i.e., input `B` is `HIGH`).
    *   *Logic: `Y` is LOW if `A=1` OR `B=1`.*

**Overall Logic (NOR):**
Combining the two conditions: The output `Y` is `HIGH` only when `A=0` AND `B=0`. In all other cases (`A=1` or `B=1`), the output is `LOW`. This is the exact definition of a **NOR** gate (`Y = (A+B)'`).

### **YOUR TURN: Topic 1.6 (Pure Memorization and Practice)**

This is the most critical part for this topic.

1.  **Draw the TTL NAND Gate:** In your notebook, draw the complete, labeled circuit for the 2-input TTL NAND gate. Include labels for `A`, `B`, `Y`, `+5V`, `GND`, `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3`, `Q4`, and the resistors.
2.  **Draw the CMOS NOR Gate:** In your notebook, draw the complete, labeled circuit for the 2-input CMOS NOR gate. Include labels for `A`, `B`, `Y`, `Vdd`, `GND`, and clearly distinguish the PMOS (often drawn with a bubble at the gate) and NMOS transistors.

**Action Plan:**
*   Look at the reference images and draw each circuit once.
*   Cover your drawing and the reference. Try to draw it from memory.
*   Compare your memory drawing to the reference. Identify mistakes.
*   Repeat this process 3-5 times for each circuit. **There is no substitute for this repetitive practice.**
